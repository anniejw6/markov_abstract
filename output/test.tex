The Q-divisor method is totaly different (we don't use the notion of a function $f_0$ on it, we consider the Dethloff and Lu's generalisation to quasi-projective varieties admitting a section of examples, we show the projective plane : the derivatives of metaplectic Eisenstein series in 6 variables
We get a characterization of connected components of moduli spaces of morphisms into a Hopf algebra
