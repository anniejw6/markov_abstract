Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. The set $\cha(X)$ of one-dimensional complex valued characters of the fundamental group of $X$ forms an algebraic group. Consider the subset of $\cha(X)$ consisting of those characters for which the corresponding local system has nontrivial cohomology in a given degree $d$. This set is shown to be a union of finitely many components that are translates of algebraic subgroups of $\cha(X)$. When the degree $d$ equals 1, it is shown that some of these components are pullbacks of the character varieties of curves under holomorphic maps. As a corollary, it is shown that the number of equivalence classes (under a natural equivalence relation) of holomorphic maps, with connected fibers, of $X$ onto smooth curves of a fixed genus $>1$ is a topological invariant of $X$. In fact it depends only on the fundamental group of $X$.
We introduce the notion of an algebraic cocycle as the algebraic analogue of a map to an Eilenberg-MacLane space. Using these cocycles we develop a ``cohomology theory" for complex algebraic varieties. The theory is bigraded, functorial, and admits Gysin maps. It carries a natural cup product and a pairing to $L$-homology. Chern classes of algebraic bundles are defined in the theory. There is a natural transformation to (singular) integral cohomology theory that preserves cup products. Computations in special cases are carried out. On a smooth variety it is proved that there are algebraic cocycles in each algebraic rational $(p,p)$-cohomology class.
We characterize the Zariski topologies over an algebraically closed field in terms of general dimension-theoretic properties. Some applications are given to complex manifold and to strongly minimal sets.
The space of holomorphic maps from $S^2$ to a complex algebraic variety $X$, i.e. the space of parametrized rational curves on $X$, arises in several areas of geometry. It is a well known problem to determine an integer $n(D)$ such that the inclusion of this space in the corresponding space of continuous maps induces isomorphisms of homotopy groups up to dimension $n(D)$, where $D$ denotes the homotopy class of the maps. The solution to this problem is known for an important but special class of varieties, the generalized flag manifolds: such an integer may be computed, and $n(D)\to\infty$ as $D\to\infty$. We consider the problem for another class of varieties, namely, toric varieties. For smooth toric varieties and certain singular ones, $n(D)$ may be computed, and $n(D)\to\infty$ as $D\to\infty$. For other singular toric varieties, however, it turns out that $n(D)$ cannot always be made arbitrarily large by a suitable choice of $D$.
We prove an existence result for stable vector bundles with arbitrary rank on an algebraic surface, and determine the birational structure of certain moduli space of stable bundles on a rational ruled surface.
Given any polynomial system with fixed monomial term structure, we give explicit formulae for the generic number of roots with specified coordinate vanishing restrictions. For the case of affine space minus an arbitrary union of coordinate hyperplanes, these formulae are also the tightest possible upper bounds on the number of isolated roots. We also characterize, in terms of sparse resultants, precisely when these upper bounds are attained. Finally, we reformulate and extend some of the prior combinatorial results of the author on which subsets of coefficients must be chosen generically for our formulae to be exact.   Our underlying framework provides a new toric variety setting for computational intersection theory in affine space minus an arbitrary union of coordinate hyperplanes. We thus show that, at least for root counting, it is better to work in a naturally associated toric compactification instead of always resorting to products of projective spaces.
For any Lagrangean K\"ahler submanifold $M \subset T^*{\Bbb C}^n$, there exists a canonical hyper K\"ahler metric on $T^*M$. A K\"ahler potential for this metric is given by the generalized Calabi Ansatz of the theoretical physicists Cecotti, Ferrara and Girardello. This correspondence provides a method for the construction of (pseudo) hyper K\"ahler manifolds with large automorphism group. Using it, a class of pseudo hyper K\"ahler manifolds of complex signature $(2,2n)$ is constructed. For any hyper K\"ahler manifold $N$ in this class a group of automorphisms with a codimension one orbit on $N$ is specified. Finally, it is shown that the bundle of intermediate Jacobians over the moduli space of gauged Calabi Yau 3-folds admits a natural pseudo hyper K\"ahler metric of complex signature $(2,2n)$.
The purpose of this paper is to translate positivity properties of the tangent bundle (and the anti-canonical bundle) of an algebraic manifold into existence and movability properties of rational curves and to investigate the impact on the global geometry of the manifold $X$. Among the results we prove are these:   \quad If $X$ is a projective manifold, and ${\cal E} \subset T_X$ is an ample locally free sheaf with $n-2\ge rk {\cal E}\ge n$, then $X \simeq \EP_n$.   \quad Let $X$ be a projective manifold. If $X$ is rationally connected, then there exists a free $T_X$-ample family of (rational) curves. If $X$ admits a free $T_X$-ample family of curves, then $X$ is rationally generated.
In this paper, we attempt to determine the quantum cohomology of projective bundles over the projective space P^n. In contrast to the previous examples, the relevant moduli spaces in our case frequently do not have expected dimensions. It makes the calculation more difficult. We overcome this difficulty by using excessive intersection theory.
In this paper, it is proved that certain stable rank-3 vector bundles can be written as extensions of line bundles and stable rank-2 bundles. As an application, we show the rationality of certain moduli spaces of stable rank-3 bundles over the projective plane P^2.
In this paper, we compare the moduli spaces of rank-3 vector bundles stable with respect to different ample divisors over rational ruled surfaces. We also discuss the irreducibility, unirationality, and rationality of these moduli spaces.
A quadric in $\R P^3$ cuts a curve of degree 6 on a cubic surface in $\R P^3$. The papers classifies the nonsingular curves cut in this way on non-singular cubic surfaces up to homeomorphism.   Two issues new in the study related to the first part of the 16th Hilbert problem appear in this classification. One is the distribution of the components of the curve between the components of the non-connected cubic surface which turns out to depend on the patterns of arrangements (see Theorem 1). The other is presence of positive genus among the components of the complement and genus-related restrictions (see Theorems 3 and 4).
The zero set of a real polynomial in two variable is a curve in $\mathbb R^2$. For a generic choice of its coefficients this is a non-singular curve, a collection of circles and lines properly embedded in $\mathbb R^2$. What topological arrangements of these circles and lines appear for the polynomials of a given degree? This question arised in the 19th century in the works of Harnack and Hilbert and was included by Hilbert into his 16th problem. Several partial results were obtained since then. However the complete answer is known only for polynomials of degree 5 or less. The paper presents a new partial result toward the solution of the 16th Hilbert problem.   The proof makes use of the proof by Kronheimer and Mrowka of the Thom conjecture in $\mathbb C P^2$.
The enumeration of points on (or off) the union of some linear or affine subspaces over a finite field is dealt with in combinatorics via the characteristic polynomial and in algebraic geometry via the zeta function. We discuss the basic relations between these two points of view. Counting points is also related to the $\ell$-adic cohomology of the arrangement (as a variety). We describe the eigenvalues of the Frobenius map acting on this cohomology, which corresponds to a finer decomposition of the zeta function. The $\ell$-adic cohomology groups and their decomposition into eigenspaces are shown to be fully determined by combinatorial data. Finally, it is shown that the zeta function is determined by the topology of the corresponding complex variety in some important cases.
We study the rigidity questions and the Albanese Variety for Complex Parallelizable Manifolds. Both are related to the study of the cohomology group $H^1(X,\mathcal O)$. In particular we show that a compact complex parallelizable manifold is rigid iff $b_1(X)=0$ iff Alb$(X)=\{e\}$ iff $H^1(X,\mathcal O)=0$.
We study flat vector bundles over complex parallelizable manifolds.
We give an elementary proof of the Pieri-type formula in the cohomology of a Grassmannian of maximal isotropic subspaces of an odd orthogonal or symplectic vector space. This proof proceeds by explicitly computing a triple intersection of Schubert varieties. The decisive step is an exact description of the intersection of two Schubert varieties, from which the multiplicities (which are powers of 2) in the Pieri-type formula are immediately obvious.
The main goal of this paper is to give a unified description for the structure of the small quantum cohomology rings for all homogeneous spaces of SL_n(C).
The purpose of this paper is to formulate a number of conjectures giving a rather complete description of the tautological ring of M_g and to discuss the evidence for these conjectures.
Looijenga recently proved that the tautological ring of M_g vanishes in degree d>g-2 and is at most one-dimensional in degree g-2, generated by the class of the hyperelliptic locus. Here we show that K_{g-2} is non-zero on M_g. The proof uses the Witten conjecture, proven by Kontsevich. With similar methods, we expect to be able to prove some (possibly all) of the identities in degree g-2 in the tautological ring that are part of the author's conjectural explicit description of the ring.
Let $V$ be a smooth, projective, convex variety. We define tautological $\psi$ and $\kappa$ classes on the moduli space of stable maps $\M_{0,n}(V)$, give a (graphical) presentation for these classes in terms of boundary strata, derive differential equations for the generating functions of the Gromov-Witten invariants of $V$ twisted by these tautological classes, and prove that these intersection numbers are completely determined by the Gromov-Witten invariants of $V$. This results in families of Frobenius manifold structures on the cohomology ring of $V$ which includes the quantum cohomology as a special case.
We show that hypergeometric differential equations, unitary and Gauss-Manin connections give rise to de Rham cohomology sheaves which do not admit a Bloch-Ogus resolution. The latter is in contrast to Panin's theorem asserting that corresponding \'etale cohomology sheaves do fulfill Bloch-Ogus theory.
We will show that the duality for regular weight systems introduced by K. Saito can be interpreted as the duality for orbifoldized Poincare polynomials.
We study tori attached to the fundamental groups of plane curves with arbitrary singularities. These tori provide complete information about homology of finite abelian covers of the plane branched along the curve. We calculate these tori in terms of certain linear systems determined by the singularities of the curve. In the case of the complements to a union of lines they can be calculated from the lattice of the arrangement and are closely related to the components of the space of Aomoto complexes with prescribed homology.
These notes are based on the lecture courses given at the Ruhr-Universit{\"a}t-Bochum (03--08.02.1997) and at the Universit{\'e} Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, 08-12.01.1996).
We study a kind of modification of an affine domain which produces another affine domain. First appeared in passing in the basic paper of O. Zariski (1942), it was further considered by E.D. Davis (1967). The first named author applied its geometric counterpart to construct contractible smooth affine varieties non-isomorphic to Euclidean spaces. Here we provide certain conditions which guarantee preservation of the topology under a modification.   As an application, we show that the group of biregular automorphisms of the affine hypersurface $X \subset C^{k+2}$ given by the equation $uv=p(x_1,...,x_k)$ where $p \in C[x_1,...,x_k],$ acts $m-$transitively on the smooth part reg$X$ of $X$ for any $m \in N.$ We present examples of such hypersurfaces diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces.
In the paper we show that for a normal-crossings degeneration $Z$ over the ring of integers of a local field with $X$ as generic fibre, the local monodromy operator and its powers determine invariant cocycle classes under the decomposition group in the cohomology of the product $X \times X$. More precisely, they also define algebraic cycles on the special fibre of a resolution of $Z \times Z$. In the paper, we give an explicit description of these cycles for a degeneration with at worst triple points as singularities. These cycles explain geometrically the presence of poles on specific local factors of the L-function related to $X \times X$.
This is a survey on the topic explained in the title, for the proceedings on the K-theory 1997 summer institute in Seattle.
The rank 4 locus of a general skew-symmetric 7x7 matrix gives the pfaffian variety in P^20 which is not defined as a complete intersection. Intersecting this with a general P^6 gives a Calabi-Yau manifold. An orbifold construction seems to give the 1-parameter mirror-family of this. However, corresponding to two points in the 1-parameter family of complex structures, both with maximally unipotent monodromy, are two different mirror-maps: one corresponding to the general pfaffian section, the other to a general intersection of G(2,7) in P^20 with a P^13. Apparently, the pfaffian and G(2,7) sections constitute different parts of the A-model (Kahler structure related) moduli space, and, thus, represent different parts of the same conformal field theory moduli space.
We use the notion of Milnor fibres of the germ of a meromorphic function and the method of partial resolutions for a study of topology of a polynomial map at infinity (mainly for calculation of the zeta-function of a monodromy). It gives effective methods of computation of the zeta-function for a number of cases and a criterium for a value to be atypical at infinity.
We give a new formula for the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class of a hypersurface in a nonsigular compact complex analytic variety. In particular this formula generalizes our previous result on the Euler characteristic of such a hypersurface. Two different approaches are presented. The first is based on the theory of characteristic cycle and the works of Sabbah, Briancon-Maisonobe-Merle, and Le-Mebkhout. In particular, this approach leads to a simple proof of a formula of Aluffi for the above mentioned class. The second approach uses Verdier's specialization property of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes. Some related new formulas are also given.
We study geometrical properties of maximal curves having classical Weierstrass gaps.
We prove a conjecture of Frenkel-Gaitsgory-Kazhdan-Vilonen on some exponential sums related to the geometric Langlands correspondence. Our main ingredients are the resolution of Lusztig scheme of lattices introduced by Laumon and the decomposition theorem of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber.
The variety of sums of powers of a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n variables is defined and investigated in some examples, old and new. These varieties are studied via apolarity and syzygies. Classical results of Sylvester (1851), Hilbert (1888), Dixon and Stuart (1906) and some more recent results of Mukai (1992) are presented together with new results for the cases (n,d)=(3,8), (4,2), (5,3). In the last case the variety of sums of 8 powers of a general cubic form is a Fano 5-fold of index 1 and degree 660.
Let $X$ be a complete algebraic variety over {\bf C}. We consider a log variety $(X,\Delta)$ that is weakly Kawamata log terminal. We assume that $K_X+\Delta$ is a {\bf Q}-Cartier {\bf Q}-divisor and that every irreducible component of $\lfloor \Delta \rfloor$ is {\bf Q}-Cartier. A nef and big Cartier divisor $H$ on $X$ is called {\it nef and log big} on $(X,\Delta)$ if $H |_B$ is nef and big for every center $B$ of non-"Kawamata log terminal" singularities for $(X,\Delta)$. We prove that, if $L$ is a nef Cartier divisor such that $aL-(K_X+\Delta)$ is nef and log big on $(X,\Delta)$ for some $a \in$ {\bf N}, then the complete linear system $| mL |$ is base point free for $m \gg 0$.
We give an algorithm to compute the following cohomology groups on $U = \C^n \setminus V(f)$ for any non-zero polynomial $f \in \Q[x_1, ..., x_n]$; 1. $H^k(U, \C_U)$, $\C_U$ is the constant sheaf on $U$ with stalk $\C$. 2. $H^k(U, \Vsc)$, $\Vsc$ is a locally constant sheaf of rank 1 on $U$. We also give partial results on computation of cohomology groups on $U$ for a locally constant sheaf of general rank and on computation of $H^k(\C^n \setminus Z, \C)$ where $Z$ is a general algebraic set. Our algorithm is based on computations of Gr\"obner bases in the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients.
Let C_1 and C_2 be two degenerations of genus g curves. We prove that if two degenerations defines the same conjugacy classes in the mapping class group, they are equivalent under analytic deformations.
This article recounts the interaction of topology and singularity theory (mainly singularities of complex algebraic varieties) which started in the early part of this century and bloomed in the 1960's with the work of Hirzebruch, Brieskorn, Milnor and others. Some of the topics are followed to the present day. (A chapter for the book "History of Topology", ed. I. M. James)
We characterize the vector bundles on G(1,4) that have no intermediate cohomology. We obtain them from extensions of the universal bundles and others related with them. In particular, we get a characterization of the universal vector bundles from their cohomology.
The aim of this note is a combinatorial description of a category of $D$-modules over an affine space, smooth along the stratification defined by an arrangement of hyperplanes. These $D$-modules are assumed to satisfy certain non-resonance condition. The main result, see Theorem 4.1, generalizes [S.Khoroshkin, $D$-modules over arrangements of hyperplanes, Comm. in Alg. 23(9) (1995), 3481-3504].
This paper aims at generalizing some geometric properties of Grassmannians of finite dimensional vector spaces to the case of Grassmannnians of infinite dimensional ones, in particular for that of $k((z))$. It is shown that the Determinant Line Bundle generates its Picard Group and that the Pl\"ucker equations define it as closed subscheme of a infinite projective space. Finally, a characterization of finite dimensional projective spaces in Grassmannians allows us to offer an approach to the study of the automorphism group.
This note consists of two parts. Part I is an exposition of (a part of) the V.Drinfeld's letter, [D].   The sheaf of algebras of polyvector fields on a Calabi-Yau manifold, equipped with the Schouten bracket, admits a structure of a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. This fact was probably first noticed by Z.Ran, [R]. Part II is devoted to some generalizations of this remark.
The Severi variety V_{n,d} of a smooth projective surface S is defined as the subvariety of the linear system |O_S(n)|, which parametrizes curves with d nodes. We show that, for a general surface S of degree k in P^3 and for all n>k-1, d=0,...,dim(|O_S(n)|), there exists one component of V_{n,d} which is reduced, of the expected dimension dim(|O_S(n)|)-d. Components of the expected dimension are the easiest to handle, trying to settle an enumerative geometry for singular curves on surfaces. On the other hand, we also construct examples of reducible Severi varieties, on general surfaces of degree k>7 in P^3.
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is an important invariant of projective algebraic varieties. A well known conjecture due to Eisenbud and Goto gives a bound for regularity in terms of the codimension and degree. This conjecture is known to be true for curves (Gruson-Lazarsfeld-Peskine) and smooth surfaces (Pinkham, Lazarsfeld), but not in general.   The purpose of this paper is to give new bounds for the regularity of smooth varieties in dimensions 3 and 4 that are only slightly worse than the optimal ones suggested by the conjecture. Our method yields new bounds up to dimension 14, but as they get progressively worse for higher dimensions, we have not written them down here.
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is an important invariant of projective algebraic varieties. A well known conjecture due to Eisenbud and Goto gives a bound for regularity in terms of the codimension and degree,i.e., Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a given variety $X$ is less than or equal to $deg(X)-codim(X)+1$. This regularity conjecture (including classification of examples on the boundary) was verified for integral curves (Castelnuovo, Gruson, Lazarsfeld and Peskine), and for smooth surfaces (Pinkham, Lazarsfeld). In this paper we prove that $reg(X) \le deg(X)-1$ for smooth threefolds $X$ in P^5 and that the only varieties on the boundary are the Segre threefold and the complete intersection of two quadrics. Furthermore, every smooth threefold $X$ in P^5 is $k$-normal for all $k \ge deg(X)-4$, which is the optimal bound as the Palatini 3-fold of degree 7 shows.
Let X be a projective irreducible smooth algebraic variety. A "fine moduli space" of sheaves on X is a family F of coherent sheaves on X parametrized by an integral variety M such that : F is flat on M; for all distinct points x, y of M the sheaves F_x, F_y on X are not isomorphic and F is a complete deformation of F_x; F has an obvious local universal property. We define also a "fine moduli space defined locally", where F is replaced by a family (F_i), where F_i is defined on an open subset U_i of M, the U_i covering M. This paper is devoted to the study of such fine moduli spaces. We first give some general results, and apply them in three cases on the projective plane : the fine moduli spaces of prioritary sheaves, the fine moduli spaces consisting of simple rank 1 sheaves, and those which come from moduli spaces of morphisms. In the first case we give an exemple of a fine moduli space defined locally but not globally, in the second an exemple of a maximal non projective fine moduli space, and in the third we find a projective fine moduli space consisting of simple torsion free sheaves, containing stable sheaves, but which is different from the corresponding moduli space of stable sheaves.
We describe the Hilbert scheme components parametrizing lines and conics on the space of determinantal nets of conics, N. As an application, we use the quantum Lefschetz hyperplane principle to compute the instanton numbers of rational curves on a complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold in N. We also compute the number of lines and conics on some Calabi-Yau sections of non-decomposable vector bundles on N. The paper contains a brief summary of the A-model theory leading up to Givental-Kim's quantum Lefschetz hyperplane principle.
We develop an approach to noncommutative algebraic geometry ``in the perturbative regime" around ordinary commutative geometry. Let R be a noncommutative algebra and A=R/[R,R] its commutativization. We describe what should be the formal neighborhood of M=Spec(A) in the (nonexistent) space Spec(R). This is a ringed space (M,O) where O is a certain sheaf of noncommutative rings on M. Such ringed spaces can be glued together to form more global objects called NC-schemes. We are especially interested in NC-manifolds, NC-schemes for which the completion of O at every point of M is isomorphic to the algebra of noncommutative power series (completion of the free associative algebra). An explicit description of the simplest NC-manifold, the affine space, is given by using the Feynman-Maslov calculus of ordered operators. We show that many familiar algebraic varieties can be naturally enlarged to NC-manifolds. Among these are all the classical flag varieties and all the smooth moduli spaces of vector bundles.
We shall investigate index 1 covers of 2-dimensional log terminal singularities. The main result is that the index 1 cover is canonical if the characteristic of the base field is different from 2 or 3. We also give some counterexamples in the case of characteristic 2 or 3. By using this result, we correct an error in a previous paper.
In this paper, we prove the l-independence of monodromy weight filtration for a geometrically smooth variety over an equicharacteristic local field. We also prove the l-independence for the geometric monodromy representation on the associated graded module of weight monodromy filtration.
This is the third of a series of papers studying real algebraic threefolds, but the methods are mostly independent from the previous two. Let $f:X\to S$ be a map of a smooth projective real algebraic 3-fold to a surface $S$ whose general fibers are rational curves.   Assume that the set of real points of $X$ is an orientable 3-manifold $M$. The aim of the paper is to give a topological description of $M$. It is shown that $M$ is either Seifert fibered or a connected sum of lens spaces. Much stronger results hold if $S$ is rational.
In this paper, we will describe the mathematical foundation of topological Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models coupled to gravity at genus 0 in terms of primitive forms. We also discuss the mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds and CP^1 in our context. We will show that the mirror partner of CP^1 is the theory of primitive form associated to f=z+qz^{-1}.
This text is an introduction to equivariant cohomology, a classical tool for topological transformation groups, and to equivariant intersection theory, a much more recent topic initiated by D. Edidin and W. Graham. It is based on lectures given at Montr\'eal is Summer 1997.   Our main aim is to obtain explicit descriptions of cohomology or Chow rings of certain manifolds with group actions which arise in representation theory, e.g. homogeneous spaces and their compactifications.   As another appplication of equivariant intersection theory, we obtain simple versions of criteria for smoothness or rational smoothness of Schubert varieties (due to Kumar, Carrell-Peterson and Arabia) whose statements and proofs become quite transparent in this framework.
We show that for a polynomial mapping F = (f_1,...,f_m): C^n \to C^m the Lojasiewicz exponent at infinity of F is attained on the set {z \in C^n : f_1(z)...f_m(z) = 0}
We study the geometry of algebraic monoids. We prove that the group of invertible elements of an irreducible algebraic monoid is an algebraic group, open in the monoid. Moreover, if this group is reductive, then the monoid is affine. We then give a combinatorial classification of reductive monoids by means of the theory of spherical varieties.
It is proved that the number of deformation types of complex structures on a fixed oriented smooth four-manifold can be arbitrarily large. The considered examples are locally simple abelian covers of rational surfaces.
In characteristic zero, semistable principal bundles on a nonsingular projective curve with a semisimple structure group form a bounded family, as shown by Ramanathan in 1970's using the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem. This was the first step in his construction of moduli for principal bundles. In this paper we prove boundedness in finite characteristics (other than characteristic 2), when the structure group is a semisimple, simply connected algebraic group of classical type. The main ingredient is an analogue of the Mukai-Sakai theorem (which says that any vector bundle admits a proper subbundle whose degree is `not too small') in the present situation.
We define the Chow ring of the classifying space of a linear algebraic group. In all the examples where we can compute it, such as the symmetric groups and the orthogonal groups, it is isomorphic to a natural quotient of the complex cobordism ring of the classifying space, a topological invariant. We apply this to get torsion information on the Chow groups of varieties defined as quotients by finite groups. This generalizes Atiyah and Hirzebruch's use of such varieties to give counterexamples to the Hodge conjecture with integer coefficients.
We prove Reider type criterions for k-jet spannedness and k-jet ampleness of adjoint bundles for surfaces with at most rational singularities. Moreover, we prove that on smooth surfaces [n(n+4)/4]-very ampleness implies n-jet ampleness.
We prove that the bicanonical system on a surface of general type with K^2=4 has no base components and describe clusters contracted by 4K_X for a numerical Godeaux surface and 3K_X for a numerical Campedelli surface.
The genus of a maximal curve over a finite field with r^2 elements is either g_0=r(r-1)/2 or less than or equal to g_1=(r-1)^2/4. Maximal curves with genus g_0 or g_1 have been characterized up to isomorphism. A natural genus to be studied is g_2=(r-1)(r-3)/8, and for this genus there are two non-isomorphism maximal curves known when r \equiv 3 (mod 4). Here, a maximal curve with genus g_2 and a non-singular plane model is characterized as a Fermat curve of degree (r+1)/2.
We study the local structure of Mori contractions $f\colon X\to Z$ of relative dimension one under an additional assumption that there exists a reduced divisor $S$ such that $K_X+S$ is plt and anti-ample.
We introduce the notion of an effective Arakelov divisor for a number field and the arithmetical analogue of the dimension of the space of sections of a line bundle. We study the analogue of the theta divisor for a number field.
We compute the first, second, third, and fifth rational cohomology groups of the moduli space of stable n-pointed genus g curves, for all g and n, using (mostly) algebro-geometric techniques.
We collect various known results (about plane curves and the moduli space of stable maps) to derive new recursive formulas enumerating low genus plane curves of any degree with various behaviors. Recursive formulas are given for the characteristic numbers of rational plane curves, elliptic plane curves, and elliptic plane curves with fixed complex structure. Recursions are also given for the number of elliptic (and rational) plane curves with various "codimension 1" behavior (cuspidal, tacnodal, triple pointed, etc., as well as the geometric and arithmetic sectional genus of the Severi variety). We compute the latter numbers for genus 2 and 3 plane curves as well. We rely on results of Caporaso, Diaz, Getzler, Harris, Ran, and especially Pandharipande.
In the present paper Mori extremal rays of a smooth projective manifold X are divided into two classes: L-supported and L-negligible (where ``L'' stands for ``Lefschetz'' since the division comes from Hard Lefschetz Theorem). Roughly speaking: L-supported rays are strongly distinguishable in topology while L-negligible rays have very mild geometry.   Each L-supported ray R defines hyperplane in H^2(X,R) on which Lefschetz duality degenerates so it is a cohomology ring invariant. The hyperplane carries a multiplicity (cohomology ring invariant) which is related to the geometry of the ray R. The number of L-supported rays is bounded.   Although the number of L-negligible rays may be infinite and they are invisible in the cohomology ring, their geometry is easier than that of L-supported rays. They are classifieable in low dimensions. Each L-negligible ray contains lots of ``good'' rational curves whose deformation is of expected dimension. In effect, L-negligible rays are invariant under deformations of complex structure and can be used to compute Gromov-Witten invariants in symplectic geometry.
We study several subseries of the space of second order theta functions on the Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic curve. In particular, we are interested in the subseries P\Gamma_{00} consisting of 2theta-divisors having multiplicity at least 4 at the origin, or, equivalently, containing the surface C-C, and in its analogues consisting of 2theta-divisors having higher multiplicities at the origin, containing the four-fold Sym^2C-Sym^2C, or singular along the surface C-C. We use rank 2 vector bundles with a given number of global sections to prove canonical isomorphisms between quotients of the above introduced subseries and vector spaces defined by the canonical divisor.
This note is a continuation of our paper with E. Zaslow "Categorical mirror symmetry: the elliptic curve", math.AG/9801119. We compare some triple Massey products on elliptic curve with the corresponding Fukaya products on the symplectic torus and recover the classical identity due to Kronecker. We also compute some triple Fukaya products such that the corresponding Massey products are not correctly defined.
This paper addresses the following question of Oort: "Are there any postive dimensional locally symmetric subvarieties of the moduli space of abelian varieties that are contained in the jacobian locus and contain the jacobian of at least one smooth curve? Some partial results are given.
For each proper divisor d of (r^2-r+1), r being a power of a prime, maximal curves over a finite field with r^2 elements covered by the Hermitian curve of genus 1/2((r^2-r+1)/d-1) are constructed.
We prove a character sum identity for Coxeter arrangements which is a finite field analogue of Macdonald's conjecture proved by Opdam.
We study the scheme of formal arcs on a singular algebraic variety and its images under truncations. We prove a rationality result for the Poincare series of these images which is an analogue of the rationality of the Poincare series associated to p-adic points on a p-adic variety. The main tools which are used are semi-algebraic geometry in spaces of power series and motivic integration (a notion introduced by M. Kontsevich). In particular we develop the theory of motivic integration for semi-algebraic sets of formal arcs on singular algebraic varieties, we prove a change of variable formula for birational morphisms and we prove a geometric analogue of a result of Oesterle.
We define motivic analogues of Igusa's local zeta functions. These functions take their values in a Grothendieck group of Chow motives. They specialize to p-adic Igusa local zeta functions and to the topological zeta functions we introduced several years ago. We study their basic properties, such as functional equations, and their relation with motivic nearby cycles. In particular the Hodge spectrum of a singular point of a function may be recovered from the Hodge realization of these zeta functions.
The aim of this note is to define certain sheaves of vertex algebras on smooth manifolds. For each smooth complex algebraic (or analytic) manifold $X$, we construct a sheaf $\Omega^{ch}_X$, called the {\bf chiral de Rham complex} of $X$. It is a sheaf of vertex algebras in the Zarisky (or classical) topology, It comes equipped with a $\BZ$-grading by {\it fermionic charge}, and the {\it chiral de Rham differential} $d_{DR}^{ch}$, which is an endomorphism of degree 1 such that $(d_{DR}^{ch})^2=0$. One has a canonical embedding of the usual de Rham complex $(\Omega_X, d_{DR})\hra (\Omega_X^{ch}, d_{DR}^{ch})$ which is a quasiisomorphism.   If $X$ is Calabi-Yau then this sheaf admits an N=2 supersymmetry. For some $X$ (for example, for curves or for the flag spaces $G/B$), one can construct also a purely even analogue of this sheaf, a {\it chiral structure sheaf} $\CO^{ch}_X$. For the projective line, the space of global sections of the last sheaf is the irreducible vacuum $\hsl(2)$-module on the critical level.
In this paper we show the lower bound of the set of non-zero $-K^2$ for normal surface singularities establishing that this set has no accumulation points from above. We also prove that every accumulation point from below is a rational number and every positive integer is an accumulation point. Every rational number can be an accumulation point modulo $\bZ$. We determine all accumulation points in $[0, 1]$. If we fix the value $-K^2$, then the values of $p_g$, $p_a$, mult, embdim and the numerical indices are bounded, while the numbers of the exceptional curves are not bounded.
We introduce motivic analogues of p-adic exponential integrals. We prove a basic multiplicativity property from which we deduce a motivic analogue of the Thom-Sebastiani Theorem. In particular, we obtain a new proof of the Thom-Sebastiani Theorem for the Hodge spectrum of (non isolated) singularities of functions.
A conjecture expressing genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants in mirror-theoretic terms of semi-simple Frobenius structures and complex oscillating integrals is formulated. The proof of the conjecture is given for torus-equivariant Gromov - Witten invariants of compact K\"ahler manifolds with isolated fixed points and for concave bundle spaces over such manifolds. Several results on genus 0 Gromov - Witten theory include: a non-linear Serre duality theorem, its application to the genus 0 mirror conjecture, a mirror theorem for concave bundle spaces over toric manifolds generalizing a recent result of B. Lian, K. Liu and S.-T. Yau. We also establish a correspondence (see the extensive footnote in section 4) between their new proof of the genus 0 mirror conjecture for quintic 3-folds and our proof of the same conjecture given two years ago.
In this note, we would like to propose a suitable extension of the arithmetic Chow group of codimension one, in which the Hodge index theorem holds. We also prove an arithmetic analogue of Bogomolov's instability theorem for rank 2 vector bundles on arbitrary regular projective arithmetic varieties.
A general type of ray class fields of global function fields is investigated. The systematic computation of their genera leads to new examples of curves over finite fields with comparatively many rational points.
We describe a relation between Arnold's strange duality and a polar duality between the Newton polytopes which is mostly due to M.~Kobayashi. We show that this relation continues to hold for the extension of Arnold's strange duality found by C.~T.~C.~Wall and the author. By a method of Ehlers-Varchenko, the characteristic polynomial of the monodromy of a hypersurface singularity can be computed from the Newton diagram. We generalize this method to the isolated complete intersection singularities embraced in the extended duality. We use this to explain the duality of characteristic polynomials of the monodromy discovered by K.~Saito for Arnold's original strange duality and extended by the author to the other cases.
The aim of this paper is to find all algebraic threefolds admitting quasi-regular Poisson structure. There are three types of such varieties: abelian varieties, smooth flat conic bundles over abelian surfaces and quotients of the product of a curve and a symplectic surface by a finite group.
The goal of this paper is to prove Riemann-Roch type theorems for Deligne-Mumford algebraic stacks. To this end, we introduce a "cohomology with coefficients in representations" and a Chern character, and we prove a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for the Riemann-Roch transformation it defines. As a corollary we obtain an Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for the Euler characteristic of a coherent sheaf, and some formulas for the different topological Euler characteristics of complex algebraic stacks.
We give an algorithmic description of the action of the Chern classes of tautological bundles on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces within the framework of Nakajima's oscillator algebra. This leads to an identification of the cohomology ring of Hilbert schemes of the affine plane with a ring of differential operators on a Fock space. We end with the computation of the top Segre classes of tautological bundles associated to line bundles on Hilb^n up to n=7, and give a conjecture for the generating series.
In this paper we prove that the Gorenstein cyclic quotient singularities of type \frac 1l (1,..., 1,l-(r-1)) with $l\geq r\geq 2$, have a \textit{unique}torus-equivariant projective, crepant, partial resolution, which is ``full'' iff either $l\equiv 0$ mod $% (r-1) $ or $l\equiv 1$ mod $(r-1) $. As it turns out, if one of these two conditions is fulfilled, then the exceptional locus of the full desingularization consists of $\lfloor \frac{l}{r-1} \rfloor$ prime divisors, $\lfloor \frac{l}{r-1}\rfloor - 1$ of which are isomorphic to the total spaces of $\Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}}^1$-bundles over $\Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}%}^{r-2}$. Moreover, it is shown that intersection numbers are computable explicitly and that the resolution morphism can be viewed as a composite of successive (normalized) blow-ups. Obviously, the monoparametrized singularity-series of the above type contains (as its ``first member'') the well-known Gorenstein singularity defined by the origin of the affine cone which lies over the $r$-tuple Veronese embedding of $\Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}}^{r-1}$.
An immediate generalization of the classical McKay correspondence for Gorenstein quotient spaces $\Bbb{C}^{r}/G$ in dimensions $r\geq 4$ would primarily demand the existence of projective, crepant, full desingularizations. Since this is not always possible, it is natural to ask about special classes of such quotient spaces which would satisfy the above property. In this paper we give explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which 2-parameter series of Gorenstein cyclic quotient singularities have torus-equivariant resolutions of this specific sort in all dimensions.
Given a generic field extension F/k of degree n>3 (i.e. the Galois group of the normal closure of F is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_n$), we prove that the norm torus, defined as the kernel of the norm map $N:R_{F/k}(G_m)\to\G_m$, is not rational over k.
In this paper we propose and discuss a mirror construction for complete intersections in partial flag manifolds $F(n_1, ..., n_l, n)$. This construction includes our previous mirror construction for complete intersection in Grassmannians and the mirror construction of Givental for complete flag manifolds. The key idea of our construction is a degeneration of $F(n_1, ..., n_l, n)$ to a certain Gorenstein toric Fano variety $P(n_1, ..., n_l, n)$ which has been investigated by Gonciulea and Lakshmibai. We describe a natural small crepant desingularization of $P(n_1, ..., n_l, n)$ and prove a generalized version of a conjecture of Gonciulea and Lakshmibai on the singular locus of $P(n_1, ..., n_l, n)$.
Let $A$ be a noetherian ring and $R_A$ be the graded ring $A[X,Y,Z,T]$. In this article we introduce the notion of a triad, which is a generalization to families of curves in ${\bf P}^3_A$ of the notion of Rao module. A triad is a complex of graded $R_A$-modules $(L_1 \to L_0 \to L_{-1})$ with certain finiteness hypotheses on its cohomology modules.   A pseudo-isomorphism between two triads is a morphism of complexes which induces an isomorphism on the functors $ h_0 (L\otimes .)$ and a monomorphism on the functors $h_{-1} (L\otimes .)$. One says that two triads are pseudo-isomorphic if they are connected by a chain of pseudo-isomorphisms.   We show that to each family of curves is associated a triad, unique up to pseudo-isomorphism, and we show that the map $\{\hbox{families of curves}\}\to \{\hbox{triads}\}$ has almost all the good properties of the map $\{\hbox{curves}\}\to \{\hbox{Rao modules}\}$.   In a section of examples, we show how to construct triads and families of curves systematically starting from a graded module and a sub-quotient (that is a submodule of a quotient module), and we apply these results to show the connectedness of $H_{4,0}$.
We define, in a purely algebraic way, 1-motives $Alb^{+}(X)$, $Alb^{-}(X)$, $Pic^{+}(X)$ and $Pic^{-}(X)$ associated with any algebraic scheme $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. For $X$ over $\C$ of dimension $n$ the Hodge realizations are, respectively, $H^{2n-1}(X)(n)$, $H_{1}(X)$, $H^{1}(X)(1)$ and $H_{2n-1}(X)(1-n)$.
We show how Chern classes of a Calabi Yau hypersurface in a toric Fano manifold can be expressed in terms of the holomorphic at a maximal degeneracy point period of its mirror. We also consider the relation between Chern classes and the periods of mirrors for complete intersections in Grassmanian Gr(2,5).
Let $G$ be a semisimple complex Lie group with a Borel subgroup $B$. Let $X=G/B$ be the flag manifold of $G$. Let $C=P^1\ni\infty$ be the projective line. Let $\alpha\in H_2(X,{\Bbb Z})$. The moduli space of $G$-monopoles of topological charge $\alpha$ (see e.g. [Jarvis]) is naturally identified with the space $M_b(X,\alpha)$ of based maps from $(C,\infty)$ to $(X,B)$ of degree $\alpha$. The moduli space of $G$-monopoles carries a natural hyperk\"ahler structure, and hence a holomorphic symplectic structure. We propose a simple explicit formula for the symplectic structure on $M_b(X,\alpha)$. It generalizes the well known formula for $G=SL_2$ (see e.g. [Atiyah-Hitchin]). Let $P\supset B$ be a parabolic subgroup. The construction of the Poisson structure on $M_b(X,\alpha)$ generalizes verbatim to the space of based maps $M=M_b(G/P,\beta)$. In most cases the corresponding map $T^*M\to TM$ is not an isomorphism, i.e. $M$ splits into nontrivial symplectic leaves. These leaves are explicilty described.
The recent two proofs for the (weak) factorization theorem for birational maps, one by W{\l}odarczyk and the other by Abramovich-Karu-Matsuki-W{\l}odarczyk rely on the results of Morelli. The former uses the process for $\pi$-desingularization (the most subtle part of Morelli's combinatorial algorithm), while the latter uses the strong factorization of toric (toroidal) birational maps directly. This paper provides a coherent account of Morelli's work (and its toroidal extension) clarifying some discrepancies in the original argument.
We prove the equivalence of the Jacobian Conjecture (JC(n)) and the Conjecture on the cardinality of the set of fixed points of a polynomial nilpotent mapping (JN(n)) and prove a series of assertions confirming JN(n).
Chisini's conjecture asserts that for a cuspidal curve $B\subset \mathbb P^2$ a generic morphism $f$ of a smooth projective surface onto $\mathbb P^2$ of degree $\geq 5$, branched along $B$, is unique up to isomorphism. We prove that if $\deg f$ is greater than the value of some function depending on the degree, genus, and number of cusps of $B$, then the Chisini conjecture holds for $B$. This inequality holds for many different generic morphisms. In particular, it holds for a generic morphism given by a linear subsystem of the $m$th canonical class for almost all surfaces with ample canonical class.
In this paper, I review the section 8 of V.V.Shokurov's paper '3-fold log flips'.
Here we prove that the minimal free resolution of a general space curve of large degree (e.g. a general space curve of degree d and genus g with d g+3, except for finitely many pairs (d,g)) is the expected one. A similar result holds even for general curves with special hyperplane section and, roughly, d g/2. The proof uses the so-called methode d'Horace.
Given a projective algebraic variety $X$, let $\Pi_p(X)$ denote the monoid of effective algebraic equivalence classes of effective algebraic cycles on $X$. The $p$-th Euler-Chow series of $X$ is an element in the formal monoid-ring $Z[[\Pi_p(X)]]$ defined in terms of Euler characteristics of the Chow varieties $\cvpd{p}{\alpha}{X}$ of $X$, with $\alpha \in\Pi_p(X)$. We provide a systematic treatment of such series, and give projective bundle formulas which generalize previous results by B. Lawson and S.S.Yau and Elizondo. The techniques used involve the Chow quotients introduced by Kapranov, and this allows the computation of various examples including some Grassmannians and flag varieties. There are relations between these examples and representation theory, and further results point to interesting connections between Euler-Chow series for certain varieties and the topology of the closure of moduli spaces $M_{0,n+1}$.
We give a geometric interpretation of the base change homomorphism between the Hecke algebra of GL(n) for an unramified extension of local fields of positive characteristic. For this, we use some results of Ginzburg, Mirkovic and Vilonen related to the geometric Satake isomorphism. We give new proof for these results in the positive characteristic case.  By using that geometric interpretation of the base change homomorphism, we prove the fundamental lemma of Jacquet and Ye for arbitrary Hecke function in the the equal characteristic case.
In this article we address the problem of computing the dimension of the space of plane curves of degree $d$ with $n$ general points of multiplicity $m$. A conjecture of Harbourne and Hirschowitz implies that when $d \geq 3m$, the dimension is equal to the expected dimension given by the Riemann-Roch Theorem. Also, systems for which the dimension is larger than expected should have a fixed part containing a multiple $(-1)$-curve. We reformulate this conjecture by explicitly listing those systems which have unexpected dimension. Then we use a degeneration technique developed in a previous article ("Degenerations of Planar Linear Systems", alg-geom/9702015) to show that the conjecture holds for all $m \leq 12$.
We study the vector bundles without intermediate cohomology on Fano threefolds of index two, degree d=3,4,5 and Betti number one. We obtain a complete characterization in the case of rank-two vector bundles. For arbitrary rank, we give all possible Chern classes of such vector bundles, under some general condition.
In this paper a formula is proved for the general degeneracy locus associated to an oriented quiver of type A_n. Given a finite sequence of vector bundles with maps between them, these loci are described by putting rank conditions on arbitrary composites of the maps. Our answer is a polynomial in Chern classes of the bundles involved, depending on the given rank conditions. It can be expressed as a linear combination of products of Schur polynomials in the differences of the bundles. The coefficients are interesting generalizations of Littlewood-Richardson numbers. These polynomials specialize to give new formulas for Schubert polynomials.
In the first part of the paper, we give an explicit algorithm to compute the (genus zero) Gromov-Witten invariants of blow-ups of an arbitrary convex projective variety in some points if one knows the Gromov-Witten invariants of the original variety. In the second part, we specialize to blow-ups of P^r and show that many invariants of these blow-ups can be interpreted as numbers of rational curves on P^r having specified global multiplicities or tangent directions in the blown-up points. We give various numerical examples, including a new easy way to determine the famous multiplicity d^{-3} for d-fold coverings of rational curves on the quintic threefold, and, as an outlook, two examples of blow-ups along subvarieties, whose Gromov-Witten invariants lead to classical multisecant formulas.
We consider a class of stable smoothable n-dimensional varieties, the analogs of stable curves. Assuming the minimal model program in dimension n+1, we prove that this class is bounded. From Kollar's method of constructing projective moduli spaces we get as a corollary that minimal model program in dimension n+1 implies the existence of a projective coarse moduli space for stable smoothable n-folds.
We show that birational smooth complex projective varieties with numerically effective canonical bundles along the exceptional loci have the same Betti numbers. In particular, birational smooth minimal models share the same Betti numbers. Our methods indicate a link between $p$-adic measure and the minimal model theory.
A meromorphic function on a compact complex analytic manifold defines a $\bc\infty$ locally trivial fibration over the complement of a finite set in the projective line $\bc\bp^1$. We describe zeta-functions of local monodromies of this fibration around atypical values. Some applications to polynomial functions on $\bc^n$ are described.
Let X be a smooth projective surface. Here we study the postulation of a general union Z of fat points of X, when most of the connected components of Z have multiplicity 2. This problem is related to the existence of "good" families of curves on X, with prescribed singularities, most of them being nodes, and to the cohomology of suitable line bundles on blowing ups of X. More precise statements are obtained in the case X=P^2.
We proved the existence of rational curves in every linear system on a general K3 surface and that all rational curves in the hyperplane class are nodal on a general K3 surface of small genus.
Families of stable curves of genus $\gamma$ over a smooth curve $C$ correspond to morphisms from $C$ to the moduli stack of stable curves $\bar{\cal M}_\gamma$. It is natural to compactify the corresponding moduli problem using stable maps into the stack. In order to get a complete moduli problem, the source curves must acquire extra structure, and you will have to read the paper to find what that is.   In this paper, we define these stable maps into $\bar{\cal M}_\gamma$ in characteristic 0, and show that they form a proper Deligne-Mumford stack admitting a projective coarse moduli space. A comparison with Alexeev's work is given.   Natural generalizations for stable maps into other Deligne-Mumford stacks will appear in a follow up paper, along with applications to areas such as admissible covers, level structures and higher dimensional families.
We investigate the possibility of embedding minimal abelian surfaces in smooth toric 4-folds with Picard number 2. The existence of such an embedding imposes conditions on the 4-fold, which we partly describe. On the other hand, we exhibit such embeddings in a special case, using a simple description of morphisms into smooth toric varieties.
We show that Horrocks' criterion for the splitting of rank two vector bundles in P^3 can be extended, with some assumptions on the Chern classes, on non singular hypersurfaces in P^4. Extension of other splitting criterion are studied.
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is an important invariant of projective algebraic varieties. A well known conjecture due to Eisenbud and Goto gives a bound for regularity in terms of the codimension and degree,i.e., Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a given variety X is less than or equal to deg(X)-codimension(X)+1. Generic projection methods proved to be effective for the study of regularity of smooth projevtive varieties of dimension at most four(cf.[BM},[K2],[L],[Pi] and [R1]) because there are nice vanishing theorems for cohomology of vector bundles (e.g. the Kodaira-Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem) and detailed information about the fibers ofgeneric projections from X to a hypersurface of the same dimension. Here we show by using methods similar to those used in [K2] that $\reg{X}\le(deg(X)-codimension(X)+1)+10$ for any smooth fivefold and $\reg{X}\le(deg(X)-codimension(X)+1)+20$ for any smooth sixfold.   Furthermore, using similar methods we give a bound for the regularity of an arbitrary (not necessarily locally Cohen-Macaulay) projective surface X in P^N. To wit, we show that $\reg{X}\le(d-e+1)d-(2e+1)$, where d=deg(X) and e=codimension(X). This is the first bound for surfaces which does not depend on smoothness.
Let $f: X \to S$ be flat morphism over an algebraically closed field $k$ with a relative normal crossings divisor $Y\subset X$, $(E, \nabla)$ be a bundle with a connection with log poles along $Y$ and curvature with values in $f^*\Omega^2_{k(S)}$. Then the Gau\ss-Manin sheaf $R^if_*(\Omega^*_{X/S}({\rm log} Y)\otimes E)$ carries a Gau\ss-Manin connection $GM^i(\nabla)$. We establish a Riemann-Roch formula relating the algebraic Chern-Simons invariants of $\nabla$, $GM^i(\nabla)$ and the top Chern class of $\Omega^1_{X/S}({\rm log}Y)$.
For a quasiprojective variety S, we define a category CHM(S) of pure Chow motives over S. Assuming conjectures of Grothendieck and Murre, we show that the decomposition theorem holds in CHM(S). As a consequence, the intersection complex of S makes sense as an object IS of CHM(S). In the forthcoming part II we will give an unconditional definition of intersection Chow groups and study some of their properties.
In 1988 S. Mori, D. Morrison, and I. Morrison gave a computer-based conjectural classification of four-dimensional cyclic quotient singularities of prime index. It was partially proven in 1990 by G. Sankaran. In 1991 Jim Lawrence basically proved this and much more, been unaware of algebro-geometric meaning of what he did. In this short note I just bring this all together to prove that all n-dimensional toric singularities with log-discrepancy greater than (or equal to) $\epsilon$ form finitely many "series".
We construct the canonical structure of an irreducible projective variety on the set of connected curves of degree $d$ in $\Bbb P^n$ with rational components (some components can be multiple). The set of rational curves is open subset in the Zariski topology under this structure.
We construct two examples of canonical exceptional singularities.
We make a detailed analysis of the A-hypergeometric system (or GKZ system) associated with a monomial curve and integral, hence resonant, exponents. We characterize the Laurent polynomial solutions and show that these are the only rational solutions. We also show that for any exponent, there are at most two linearly independent Laurent solutions, and that the upper bound is reached if and only if the curve is not arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay. We then construct, for all integral parameters, a basis of local solutions in terms of the roots of the generic univariate polynomial associated with A. We determine the holonomic rank r for all integral exponents and show that it is constantly equal to the degree d of X if and only if X is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. Otherwise there is at least one exponent for which r = d + 1.
We describe algorithms for computing various functors for algebraic D-modules, i.e. systems of linear partial differential equations with polynomial coefficients. We will give algorithms for restriction, tensor product, localization, and local cohomology groups for all degrees.
The `linear orbit' of a plane curve of degree d is its orbit in the projective space of dimension d(d+3)/2 parametrizing such curves under the natural action of PGL(3). In this paper we compute the degree of the closure of the linear orbits of most curves with positive dimensional stabilizers. Our tool is a nonsingular variety dominating the orbit closure, which we construct by a blow-up sequence mirroring the sequence yielding an embedded resolution of the curve.   The results given here will serve as an ingredient in the computation of the analogous information for arbitrary plane curves. Linear orbits of smooth plane curves are studied in [A-F1].
We complete the proof of the fact that the moduli space of rank two bundles with trivial determinant embeds into the linear system of divisors on $Pic^{g-1}C$ which are linearly equivalent to $2\Theta$. The embedded tangent space at a semi-stable non-stable bundle $\xi\oplus\xi^{-1}$, where $\xi$ is a degree zero line bundle, is shown to consist of those divisors in $|2\Theta|$ which contain $Sing(\Theta_{\xi})$ where $\Theta_{\xi}$ is the translate of $\Theta$ by $\xi$. We also obtain geometrical results on the structure of this tangent space.
Let X be a projective complex 3-fold, quasihomogeneous with respect to an action of a linear algebraic group. We show that X is a compactification of SL_2/G, G a discrete subgroup, or that X can be equivariantly transformed into the 3-dim. projective space, the quadric Q_3, or into certain quasihomogeneous bundles with very simple structure.
In the present work we classify the relatively minimal 3-dimensional quasihomogeneous complex projective varieties under the assumption that the automorphism group is not solvable. By relatively minimal we understand varieties X having at most Q-factorial terminal singularities and allowing an extremal contraction X to Y, where dim Y <3.
In the present work we describe 3-dimensional complex SL_2-varieties where the generic SL_2-orbit is a surface. We apply this result to classify the minimal 3-dimensional projective varieties with Picard-number 1 where a semisimple group acts such that the generic orbits are 2-dimensional.   This is an ingredient of the classification [Keb98, math.AG/9805042] of the 3-dimensional relatively minimal quasihomogeneous varieties where the automorphism group is not solvable.
This is the first part of two papers. In this part, we prove the blowup formulae for virtual Hodge polynomials of Gieseker moduli spaces of rank-2 stable sheaves and Uhlenbeck compactification spaces over algebraic surfaces. In particular, we verify the blowup formulae for the S-duality conjecture of Vafa-Witten, i.e. the blowup formulae for the Euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces over algebraic surfaces.
This is the second part of two papers. In this part, we establish closed formulae for the universal functions in the blowup formulae for virtual Hodge polynomials of Gieseker moduli spaces of rank-2 stable sheaves and Uhlenbeck compactification spaces over algebraic surfaces.
We extend the methods of geometric invariant theory to actions of non--reductive groups in the case of homomorphisms between decomposable sheaves whose automorphism groups are non--reductive. Given a linearization of the natural action of the group $\Aut(E)\times\Aut(F)$ on Hom(E,F), a homomorphism is called stable if its orbit with respect to the unipotent radical is contained in the stable locus with respect to the natural reductive subgroup of the automorphism group. We encounter effective numerical conditions for a linearization such that the corresponding open set of semi-stable homomorphisms admits a good and projective quotient in the sense of geometric invariant theory, and that this quotient is in addition a geometric quotient on the set of stable homomorphisms.
This is a report on some recent work by Gaffney, Massey, and the author, characterizing the conditions A_f and W_f for a family of ICIS germs equipped with a function. First we introduce the work informally. Then we review the formal definitions of A_f and W_f, and state the theorems that characterize them by the constancy of Milnor numbers. Next we review the definition of the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity, and reformulate the theorems by the constancy of certain Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities. Finally, we review the theory of integral dependence of elements on submodules of free modules, and apply it to prove the reformulated theorems.
We classify all products of flag varieties with finitely many orbits under the diagonal action of the general linear group. We also classify the orbits in each case and construct explicit representatives. This generalizes the classical Schubert decompostion, which states that the GL(n)-orbits on a product of two flag varieties correspond to permutations. Our main tool is the theory of quiver representations.
This paper is withdrawn. The current main theorem can be proved by using a simple field theory. The main theorem is to placed by another theorem, shortly.
We consider an equisingularity problem for polynomial families of affine hypersurfaces $X_\tau \subset \bC^n$. We show that the constancy of the global polar invariants $\gamma^* (X_\tau)$ is equivalent to the $t$-equisingularity at infinity, an asymptotic-type equisingularity that we introduce. We prove that $\gamma^*$-constancy implies C$^\ity$-triviality in the neighbourhood of infinity. We show how the invariants $\gamma^*$ enter in the description of a CW-complex model of a hypersurface $X_\tau$ and therefore provide in particular new invariants at infinity for polynomial functions $f: \bC^n \to \bC$.
We analyse the Gauss-Manin system of differential equations---and its Fourier transform---attached to regular functions satisfying a tameness assupmption on a smooth affine variety over C (e.g. tame polynomials on C^{n+1}). We give a solution to the Birkhoff problem and prove Hodge-type results analogous to those existing for germs of isolated hypersurface singularities.
By a K3-surface with nine cusps I mean a compact complex surface with nine isolated double points $A_2$, but otherwise smooth, such that its minimal desingularisation is a K3-surface. In an earlier paper I showd that each such surface is a quotient of a complex torus by a cyclic group of order three. Here I try to classify these $K3$-surfaces, using the period map for complex tori. In particular I show:   A $K3$-surface with nine cusps carries polarizations only of degrees 0 or 2 modulo 6. This implies in particular that there is no quartic surface in projective three-space with nine cusps. (T. Urabe pointed out to me how to deduce this from a theorem of Nikulin.)   In an appendix I give explicit equations of quartic surfaces in three-space with eight cusps.
We prove that, for an analytic family of ``weakly tame'' regular functions on an affine manifold, the spectrum at infinity of each function of the family is semicontinuous in the sense of Varchenko.
We show that, given a projective regular function f on a smooth quasi-projective variety over C, the corresponding cohomology groups of the algebraic de Rham complex with twisted differential d-df and of the complex of algebraic forms with differential df have the same dimension (a result announced by Barannikov and Kontsevitch). We generalize the result to de Rham complexes with coefficients in a mixed Hodge Module.
Let $f_i$ be polynomials in $n$ variables without a common zero. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that there are polynomials $g_i$ such that $\sum g_if_i=1$. The effective versions of this result bound the degrees of the $g_i$ in terms of the degrees of the $f_j$. The aim of this paper is to generalize this to the case when the $f_i$ are replaced by arbitrary ideals. Applications to the B\'ezout theorem, to \L ojasiewicz--type inequialities and to deformation theory are also discussed.
It has been proved several times in the literature that a polynomial map from $C^2$ to $C$ with irreducible rational fibers cannot be a component of a counterexample to the Jacobian Conjecture. This note points out that this result is empty: it is implicit in 1980 work of Miyanish and Sugie that such a polynomial is equivalent to $f(x,y)=x$ by a polynomial automorphism of $C^2$.
These are the informal notes of two seminars held at the Universita` di Roma "La Sapienza", and at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in Spring and Autumn 1997. We discuss in detail the content of the parts of Givental's paper dealing with mirror symmetry for projective complete intersections.
In preprint alg-geom/9708009 we have constructed a (ten-dimensional) symplectic desingularization of the moduli space of rank-two torsion-free semistable sheaves on a $K3$, with trivial determinant and second Chern class equal to 4. In the present paper we prove that (every deformation of) this desingularization is a new irreducible symplectic variety. More precisely we show that the desingularization is irreducible symplectic, and that its second Betti number is at least 24.
The purpose of these notes is to give an introduction to Deligne-Mumford stacks and their moduli spaces, with emphasis on the moduli problem for curves. The paper has 4 sections. In section 1 we discuss the general problem of constructing a moduli "space" of curves. In section 2 we give an introduction to Deligne-Mumford stacks and their moduli spaces. In section 3 we return to curves and outline Deligne and Mumford's proof that the stack of stable curves is a smooth and irreducible Deligne-Mumford stack which is proper over Spec Z. In section 4 we explain how to use geometric invariant to construct moduli spaces for quotient stacks. Finally, we briefly outline Gieseker's geometric invariant theory construction of the moduli scheme of projective curves defined over an algebraically closed field.   These notes are a slightly revised version of notes which the author has circulated privately for several years, and are based on lectures the author gave at the Weizmann Institute in July 1994. They are also available at the URL http://math.missouri.edu/~edidin/Papers/ Any updates will be posted to this URL.
One of the simplest examples of a smooth, non degenerate surface in P^4 is the quintic elliptic scroll. It can be constructed from an elliptic normal curve E by joining every point on E with the translation of this point by a non-zero 2-torsion point. The same construction can be applied when E is replaced by a (lineaerly normally embedded) abelian variety A. In this paper we ask the question when the resulting scroll Y is smooth. If A is an abelian surface embedded by a line bundle L of type (d_1,d_2) and r=d_1d_2, then we prove that for general A the scroll Y is smooth if r is at least 7 with the one exception where r=8 and the 2-torsion point is in the kernel K(L) of L. In this case Y is singular.The case r=7 is particularly interesting, since then Y is a smooth threefold in P^6 with irregularity 2. The existence of this variety seems not to have been noticed before. One can also show that the case of the quintic elliptic scroll and the above case are the only possibilities where Y is smooth and the codimension of Y is at most half the dimension of the surrounding projective space.
We define a quasi--projective reduction of a complex algebraic variety $X$ to be a regular map from $X$ to a quasi--projective variety that is universal with respect to regular maps from $X$ to quasi--projective varieties. A toric quasi--projective reduction is the analogous notion in the category of toric varieties. For a given toric variety $X$ we first construct a toric quasi--projective reduction. Then we show that $X$ has a quasi--projective reduction if and only if its toric quasi--projective reduction is surjective. We apply this result to characterize when the action of a subtorus on a quasi--projective toric variety admits a categorical quotient in the category of quasi--projective varieties.
We show how for every integer n one can explicitly construct n distinct plane quartics and one hyperelliptic curve over the complex numbers all of whose Jacobians are isomorphic to one another as abelian varieties without polarization. When we say that the curves can be constructed ``explicitly'', we mean that the coefficients of the defining equations of the curves are simple rational expressions in algebraic numbers in R whose minimal polynomials over Q can be given exactly and whose decimal approximations can be given to as many places as is necessary to distinguish them from their conjugates. We also prove a simply-stated theorem that allows one to decide whether or not two plane quartics over the complex numbers, each with a pair of commuting involutions, are isomorphic to one another.
In this paper we give for all $n \geq 2$, d>0, $g \geq 0$ necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a pair (X,C), where X is a K3 surface of degree 2n in $\matbf{P}^{n+1}$ and C is a smooth (reduced and irreducible) curve of degree d and genus g on X. The surfaces constructed have Picard group of minimal rank possible (being either 1 or 2), and in each case we specify a set of generators. For $n \geq 4$ we also determine when X can be chosen to be an intersection of quadrics (in all other cases X has to be an intersection of both quadrics and cubics). Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $\O_C (k)$ to be non-special, for any integer $k \geq 1$.
The special geometry of calibrated cycles, closely related to mirror symmetry among Calabi--Yau 3-folds, is itself a real form of a new subject, which we call slightly deformed algebraic geometry. On the other hand, both of these geometries are parallel to classical gauge theories and their complexifications. This article explains this parallelism, so that the appearance of invariants of new type in complexified gauge theory (see Donaldson--Thomas [D-T] and Thomas [T]) can be accompanied by analogous invariants in the theory of special Lagrangian cycles, for which the development is at present much more modest than in gauge theory. We discuss related geometric constructions, arising from mirror symmetry and symplectic geometry.
Barth and Nieto have found a remarkable quintic threefold which parametrizes Heisenberg invariant Kummer surfaces which belong to abelian surfaces with a (1,3)-polarization and a lecel 2 structure. A double cover of this quintic, which is also a Calabi-Yau variety, is birationally equivalent to the moduli space {\cal A}_3(2) of abelian surfaces with a (1,3)-polarization and a level 2 structure. As a consequence the corresponding paramodular group \Gamma_3(2) has a unique cusp form of weight 3. In this paper we find this cusp form which is \Delta_1^3. The form \Delta_1 is a remarkable weight 1 cusp form with a character with respect to the paramodular group \Gamma_3. It has several interesting properties. One is that it admits an infinite product representation, the other is that it vanishes of order 1 along the diagonal in Siegel space. In fact \Delta_1 is an element of a short series of modular forms with this last property. Using the fact that \Delta_1 is a weight 3 cusp form with respect to the group \Gamma_3(2) we give an independent construction of a smooth projective Calabi-Yau model of the moduli space {\cal A}_3(2).
Green's Conjecture states the following : syzygies of the canonical model of a curve are simple up to the p^th stage if and only if the Clifford index of C is greater than p. We prove that the generic curve of genus g satisfies Green's conjecture.
We give a formula for the spectral pairs (after Steenbrink) for composite singularities of several variables. (Note that for two variable case is studyed by Nemethi-Steenbrink.) Here composite singularity is given by the equation f(g_1, ..., g_n) = 0. For technical reason, we assume that f is non-degenerated with respect to the Newton boundary.
In this paper we study normal surfaces whose anticanonical divisors are strictly nef, i.e. (-K)C>0 for every curve C.
A singularity is said to be exceptional (in the sense of V. Shokurov), if for any log canonical boundary, there is at most one exceptional divisor of discrepancy -1. In our previous paper (math.AG/9805004) we found two examples of exceptional canonical singularities: these are quotients by Klein's simple group of order 168 or by its central extension of order 504. Now we classify all the three-dimensional exceptional quotient singularities.
Assume that $X$ is a surface over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $\tilde{X}$ be obtained from $X$ by blowing up a smooth point and let $L$ be the exceptional curve. Let $\coh(X)$ be the category of coherent sheaves on $X$. In this note we show how to recover $\coh({X})$ from $\coh(\tilde{X})$, if we know the object $\Oscr_L(L)$.
We denote by FPMC the class of all non-singular projective algebraic surfaces X over C with a finite polyhedral Mori cone NE(X)\subset NS(X)\otimes R. If rho(X)=rk NS(X)\ge 3, then the set Exc(X) of all exceptional curves on X\in FPMC is finite and generates NE(X). Let \delta_E(X) be the maximum of (-E^2) and p_E(X) the maximum of p_a(E) respectively for E\in Exc(X). For fixed \rho \ge 3, \delta_E and p_E we denote by FPMC_{\rho,\delta_E,p_E} the class of all X\in FPMC such that \rho(X)=\rho, \delta_E(X)=\delta_E and p_E(X)=p_E. We prove that the class FPMC_{\rho,\delta_E,p_E} is bounded: for any X\in FPMC_{\rho,\delta_E,p_E} there exist an ample effective divisor h and a very ample divisor h' such that h^2\le N(\rho,\delta_E) and {h'}^2\le N'(\rho,\delta_E,p_E) where the constants N(\rho,\delta_E)$ and N'(\rho,\delta_E,p_E) depend only on (\rho, \delta_E) and (\rho, \delta_E, p_E) respectively.   One can consider Theory of surfaces X\in FPMC as Algebraic Geometry analog of the Theory of arithmetic reflection groups in hyperbolic spaces.
In this paper we compute the generating function for the Euler characteristic of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of smooth n-pointed genus 2 curves.
We consider the action of a subtorus of the big torus on a toric variety. The aim of the paper is to define a natural notion of a quotient for this setting and to give an explicit algorithm for the construction of this quotient from the combinatorial data corresponding to the pair consisting of the subtorus and the toric variety. Moreover, we study the relations of such quotients with good quotients. We construct a good model, i.e. a dominant toric morphism from the given toric variety to some ``maximal'' toric variety having a good quotient by the induced action of the given subtorus.
The LCS locus is an essential ingredient in the proof of fundamental results of Log Minimal Model Program, such as nonvanishing and base point freeness theorems. We prove in this paper that the LCS locus of a log canonical variety has seminormal singularities.
We introduce the operation of forming the tensor product in the theory of analytic Frobenius manifolds. Building on the results for formal Frobenius manifolds which we extend to the additional structures of Euler fields and flat identities, we prove that the tensor product of pointed germs of Frobenius manifolds exists. Furthermore, we define the notion of a tensor product diagram of Frobenius manifolds with factorizable flat identity and prove the existence such a diagram and hence a tensor product Frobenius manifold. These diagrams and manifolds are unique up to equivalence. Finally, we derive the special initial conditions for a tensor product of semi--simple Frobenius manifolds in terms of the special initial conditions of the factors.
This is a paper based on a talk given at the Warwick Symposium on Algebraic Geometry in 1996. The resolution of singularities given by F. Bogomolov and A. Pantev (arXiv:math.AG/9603019) is presented in a self-contained and "elementary" manner. The main result is that given a variety and a proper closed subvariety, there is a projective birational morphism from a smooth variety to the given variety so that the inverse image of the given closed subvariety and the exceptional locus are sub-divisors of a divisor with simple normal crossings.
Consider a holomorphic torus action on vector bundles over a complex manifold which lifts to a holomorphic vector bundle. When the connected components of the fixed-point set are partially ordered, we construct, using sheaf-theoretical techniques, two spectral sequences that converges to the twisted Dolbeault cohomology groups and those with compact support, respectively. These spectral sequences are the holomorphic counterparts of the instanton complex in standard Morse theory. The results proved imply holomorphic Morse inequalities and fixed-point formulas on a possibly non-compact manifold. Finally, a number of examples and applications are given.
We study nonsingular branched coverings of a homogeneous space X. There is a vector bundle associated with such a covering which was conjectured by O. Debarre to be ample when the Picard number of X is one. We prove this conjecture, which implies Barth-Lefschetz type theorems, for lagrangian grassmannians, and for quadrics up to dimension six. We propose a conjectural extension to homogeneous spaces of Picard number larger than one and prove a weaker version.
This article accompanies my June 1998 seminaire Bourbaki talk on Givental's work. After a quick review of descendent integrals in Gromov-Witten theory, I discuss Givental's formalism relating hypergeometric series to solutions of quantum differential equations arising from hypersurfaces in projective space. A particular case of this relationship is a proof of the Mirror prediction for the numbers of rational curves on the Calabi-Yau quintic 3-fold. The approach taken here is entirely algebro-geometric and relies upon a localization formula on the moduli space of stable genus 0 maps to projective space. A different proof of the quintic Mirror prediction may be found in the work of Lian, Liu, and Yau.
A consistent exposition of the arguments and constructions of the method of maximal singularities, the aim of which is to describe birational iso/automorphisms of Fano varieties and Fano fibrations. The principal elements of the method are considered: N{\" o}ther-Fano inequality, maximal cycles, infinitely near maximal singularities, exclusion and untwisting. In a detailed way the crucial technical points are discussed. We also give a new version of the proof of Sarkisov theorem which is ideologically more close to the original arguments of V.A.Iskovskikh and Yu.I.Manin.
Consider a polarized abelian variety $(A,L)$ over the field of complex numbers. Following Demailly, one can associate to $(A,L)$ a real number $\epsilon(A,L)$, its {\em Seshadri constant}, which in effect measures how much of the positivity of $L$ can be concentrated at any given point of $A$. There has been considerable recent interest in finding bounds on the Seshadri constants of abelian varieties and on smooth projective varieties in general. In the present paper we first generalize an approach of Buser and Sarnak to give a lower bound on the minimal period length of $(A,L)$ in terms of the type of the polarization, which by a recent result of Lazarsfeld leads to a lower bound on the Seshadri constant of $(A,L)$. Secondly, we consider Prym varieties and show that they have small Seshadri constants and therefore unusually small periods. Finally, we obtain refined results for the case of abelian surfaces, which imply in particular the surprising fact that Seshadri constants are always rational in this case.
We characterize the triples (X,L,H), consisting of holomorphic line bundles L and H on a complex projective manifold X, such that for some positive integer k, the k-th holomorphic jet bundle of L, J_k(L), is isomorphic to a direct sum H+...+H. Given the geometrical constrains imposed by a projectivized line bundle being a product of the base and a projective space it is natural to expect that this would happen only under very rare circumstances. It is shown, in fact, that X is either an Abelian variety or projective space. In the former case L\cong H is any line bundle of Chern class zero. In the later case for k a positive integer, L=O_{P^n}(q) with J_k(L)=H+...+H if and only if H=O_{P^n}(q-k) and either q\ge k or q\le -1.
An algebraic variety X is embedded to the order k via a line bundle L if the global sections of L generate all (simultaneous) jets of order k on X or if they separate all zero-dimensional subschemes of length at most k+1. Even though we refer to both situations as "higher order embeddings", the first notion (in which case L is said to be k-jet ample) is stronger than the second one (when L is k-very ample).  The purpose of this paper is to study higher order embeddings of cyclic coverings \pi:Y\to X via line bundles given by pulling back "sufficiently positive" line bundles on X. Given a line bundle L on X, we relate the order of the embedding defined by \pi^*L to that of L and of certain rank 1 summands of the vector bundle L\tensor\pi_*\calo_Y. As expected, the sufficient conditions for \pi^*L to be k-jet ample are stronger then the ones needed in order for \pi^*L to be k-very ample.
Inspired by some recent work of M. Farber, W. L\"uck and M. Shubin on L2 homotopy invariants of infinite Galois coverings of simplicial complexes (L2 Betti numbers and Novikov-Shubin invariants), this article extends Atiyah's L2 index theory to coherent analytic sheaves on complex analytic spaces. Let $X$ be a complex analytic space with a proper cocompact biholomorphic action of a discrete group $G$. Let $F$ be a $G$-equivariant coherent analytic sheaf on $X$. We give a meaningful notion of a L2 section of $F$ on $X$. We also construct L2 cohomology groups. We prove that these L2 cohomology groups belong to an abelian category of topological $G$-modules introduced by M. Farber. On this category there are two kinds of invariants: Von Neumann dimension and Novikov-Shubin invariants. The alternating sum of the Von Neumann dimensions of the L2 cohomology groups of $F$ can be computed by an analogue of Atiyah's L2 index theorem. Novikov-Shubin invariants show up when the L2 cohomology groups are non-Hausdorff and, like in algebraic topology, are still very intriguing (and not very well understood).
We give the new effective criterion for the global generation of the adjoint bundle on normal surfaces with a boundary. We could make the invariant \delta small a bit more on log-terminal singular point, and then we could prove the theorem described in my previous paper "alg-geom/9612018" as a corollary.
We classify completely the surfaces of general type whose canonical map is 3-to-1 onto a surface of minimal degree in projective space. These surfaces fall into 5 distinct classes and we give explicit examples belonging to each of these classes. As far as we know, one of the examples thus constructed was unknown and it is a surface whose canonical system has two infinitely near base points.
On a real regular elliptic surface without multiple fiber, the Betti number $h_1$ and the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ are related by $h_1\leq h^{1,1}$. We prove that it's always possible to deform such algebraic surface to obtain $h_1=h^{1,1}$. Furthermore, we can impose that each homology class can be represented by a real algebraic curve. We use a real version of the modular construction of elliptic surfaces.
Nous montrons que les seules vari\'et\'es toriques munies d'une structure de contact sont, \`a isomorphisme pr\`es, les espaces projectifs complexes et les vari\'et\'es $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{P}^{1}} (\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{P}^{1}})$.
We prove a structure theorem for the differential operator in the 0-term of the ${\cal V}$-filtration with respect to a free divisor. Using this theorem, we give a formula for the logarithmic de Rham complex in terms of ${\cal V}_0$-modules. We also give a sufficient condition for perversity of the logarithmic de Rham complex.
In this note we study contact structures on 5-dimensional manifolds. We give a complete answer under the assumption that the Abundance conjecture holds in dimension 5.
Problem: Given a reductive algebraic group G, find all k-tuples of parabolic subgroups (P_1,...,P_k) such that the product of flag varieties G/P_1 x ... x G/P_k has finitely many orbits under the diagonal action of G. In this case we call G/P_1 x ... x G/P_k a multiple flag variety of finite type. (If P_1 is a Borel subgroup, the partial product G/P_2 x ... x G/P_k is a spherical variety.)   In this paper we solve this problem in the case of the symplectic group G = Sp(2n). We also give a complete enumeration of the orbits, and explicit representatives for them. (It is well known that for k=2 the orbits are essentially Schubert varieties.) Our main tool is the algebraic theory of quiver representations. Rather unexpectedly, it turns out that we can use the same techniques in the present case as we did for G = GL(n) in math.AG/9805067.
We address the problem of determining the degree a plane curve must have in order to pass with multiplicity m through r points in general position. A conjecture of Nagata states that one must have d > m \sqrt{r}. We prove the inequalities d \geq m(r-1)\prod_{i=2}^{r-1}(1-i/(i^2+r-1)) and d > m (\sqrt{r-1} - \pi/8).
Our earlier proof of mirror formulas for genus 0 Gromov -- Witten invariants of Fano and Calabi -- Yau toric complete intersections is illustrated in the example of quintic 3-folds.

Let E be an ample vector bundle of rank r on a complex projective manifold X such that there exists a section $s \in \Gamma(\cal E)$ whose zero locus Z = (s = 0) is a smooth submanifold of the expected dimension dim X - r: = n -r. Assume that Z is not minimal; we investigate the hypothesis under which the extremal contractions of Z can be lifted to X. Finally we study in detail the cases in which Z is a scroll, a quadric bundle or a del Pezzo fibration.
We prove a topological result concerning the kernel of a morphism d : E --> F of holomorphic vector bundles over a complex analytic space. As a consequence, we show that the projectivization P(ker d) is a quasifibration up to some dimension. We give an application to the Abel-Jacobi map of a Riemann surface, and to the space of rational curves in the symmetric product of a Riemann surface.
Let X be a (possibly nodal) K-trivial threefold moving in a fixed ambient space P. Suppose X contains a continuous family of curves, all of whose members satisfy certain unobstructedness conditions in P. A formula is given for computing the corresponding virtual number of curves, that is, the number of curves on a generic deformation of X "contributed by" the continuous family on X.
For an affine variety $S$ we consider the ring $AK(S),$ which is the intersection of the rings of constants of all locally-nilpotent derivations of the ring $\Cal {O}(S).$ We show that $AK(S\times\Bbb {C}^n)=AK(S)$ for a smooth affine surface $S$ with $H^2(S,\Bbb {Z})=\{0\}.$
In this paper we construct arithmetic analogs of the Riemann-Roch theorem and Serre's duality for line bundles. This improves on the works of Tate and van der Geer - Schoof. We define $H^0(L)$ and $H^1(L)$ as some convolution of measures structures. The $H^1$ is defined by a procedure very similar to the usual Cech cohomology. We get Serre's duality as Pontryagin duality of convolution structures. We get separately Riemann-Roch formula and Serre's duality. Instead of using the Poisson summation formula, we basically reprove it. The whole theory is pretty much parallel to the geometric case.

In this note we give examples of Zariski's pairs $B_{1,m}, B_{2,m}$ ($m \in N$ and $m \geq 5$) of plane cuspidal curves such that   (i) $B_{i,m}$ is the discriminant curve of a generic morphism $f_{i,m}:S_i \to P^2$, $i=1, 2$,   (ii) $S_1$ and $S_2$ are homeomorphic surfaces of general type,   (iii) $f_{i,m}$ is given by linear three-dimensional subsystem of the mth canonical class of $S_i$.
We classify, up to isomorphism, maximal curves covered by the Hermitian curve \mathcal H by a prime degree Galois covering. We also compute the genus of maximal curves obtained by the quotient of \mathcal H by several automorphisms groups. Finally we discuss the value for the third largest genus that a maximal curve can have.
Let $X=\C^n$. In this paper we present an algorithm that computes the de Rham cohomology groups $H^i_{dR}(U,\C)$ where $U$ is the complement of an arbitrary Zariski-closed set $Y$ in $X$. Our algorithm is a merger of the algorithm given by T.~Oaku and N.~Takayama (\cite{O-T2}), who considered the case where $Y$ is a hypersurface, and our methods from \cite{W-1} for the computation of local cohomology. We further extend the algorithm to compute de Rham cohomology groups with support $H^i_{dR,Z}(U,\C)$ where again $U$ is an arbitrary Zariski-open subset of $X$ and $Z$ is an arbitrary Zariski-closed subset of $U$. Our main tool is the generalization of the restriction process from \cite{O-T1} to complexes of modules over the Weyl algebra. All presented algorithms are based on Gr\"obner basis computations in the Weyl algebra.
This note is an attempt to generalize Bolibruch's theorem from the projective line to curves of higher genus. We show that an irreducible representation of the fundamental group of an open in a curve of higher genus has always a representation as a regular system of differential equations on a semistable bundle of degree 0. Vice-versa, we show that given such a bundle and 3 points on the curve, one can construct an irreducible representation of the curve minus the 3 points such that an associated regular system of differential equations lives on this bundle.
Let (S,H) be a rational algebraic surface with an ample divisor. We compute generating functions for the Hodge numbers of the moduli spaces of H-stable rank 2 sheaves on S in terms of certain theta functions for indefinite lattices that were introduced in the paper alg-geom/9612020 written jointly with Don Zagier. If H lies in the closure of the ample cone and has self-intersection 0, it follows that the generating functions are Jacobi forms. In particular the generating functions for the Euler numbers have a similar transformation behaviour under SL(2,Z) as that predicted in Vafa and Witten: A strong coupling test of S-duality. In addition we get that also the generating functions for the signatures can be expressed in terms of modular forms. Finally it turns out that the generating function for the signatures is also (with respect to another developping parameter) the generating function for the Donaldson invariants of S evaluated on all powers of the point class. The paper is related to the recent papers math.AG/9805003 by Yoshioka, math.AG/9805054 and math.AG/9805055 by Qin and Li and hep-th/9802168 by Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa and Warner.
We give an elementary argument for the well known fact that the endomorphism algebra $End_Q(A)$ of a simple complex abelian surface $A$ can neither be an imaginary quadratic field nor a definite quaternion algebra. Another consequence of our argument is that a two-dimensional complex torus $T$ with $Q(\sqrt{d})\subseteq End_Q(A)$ where $Q(\sqrt{d})$ is real quadratic, is algebraic.
In the 80's D. Eisenbud and J. Harris developed the general theory of limit linear series, Invent. math. 85 (1986), in order to understand what happens to linear systems and their ramification points on families of non-singular curves degenerating to curves of compact type. They applied their theory to the study of limits of Weierstrass points, among other endeavours. In one of their articles, Invent. math. 87 (1987), they asked: "What are the limits of Weierstrass points in families of curves degenerating to stable curves not of compact type?" In this eprint we address this question within a more general framework. More precisely, given a family of linear systems on a family of non-singular curves degenerating to a nodal curve we give a formula for the limit of the associated ramification divisors in terms of certain limits of the family of linear systems. In contrast with the theory of limit linear series of Eisenbud's and Harris', we do not need to blow up the family to swerve the degenerating ramification points away from the nodes of the limit curve. Indeed, we can assign the adequate weight to the limit ramification divisor at any point of the limit curve. In a forthcoming submission we shall deal with the specific question of limits of Weierstrass points, assuming certain generic conditions.
It is proved that the group of birational automorphisms of a three-dimensional double quadric with a singular point arising from a double point on the branch divisor is a semidirect product of the free group generated by birational involutions of a special form and the group of regular automorphisms. The proof is based on the method of `untwisting' maximal singularities of linear systems.
We recursively compute the Gromov-Witten invariants of the Hilbert scheme of two points in the plane. By studying the space of stable maps and computing virtual contributions, we use these invariants to enumerate hyperelliptic plane curves of degree d and genus g passing through 3d+1 general points.
Let X be a smooth complex projective curve of genus g bigger or equal to 1. If g is bigger than 1 assume further that X is either bielliptic or with general moduli. Under a natural condition on slopes, we prove that there exists a short exact sequence of semistable vector bundles with given ranks and degrees. The importance of the paper consists of the new method adopted for the proves.
This article contains a new argument which proves vanishing of the first cohomology for negative vector bundles over a complex projective variety if the rank of the bundle is smaller than the dimension of the base. Similar argument is applied to the construction of holomorphic functions on the universal covering of the complex projective variety .
Insprired by the work of C. Simpson, it is shown that every variation of graded-polarized mixed Hodge structure defined over Q gives rise to a natural Higgs field on the underlying vector bundle. In the context of Mirror Symmetry it is then shown that these Higgs fields share an intimate relationship with Quantum Cohomology.
The space of complete collineations is a compactification of the space of matrices of fixed dimension and rank, whose boundary is a divisor with normal crossings. It was introduced in the 19th century and has been used to solve many enumerative problems.   We show that this venerable space can be understood using the latest quotient constructions in algebraic geometry. Indeed, there is a detailed analogy between the complete collineations and the moduli space of stable pointed curves of genus zero. The remarkable results of Kapranov exhibiting the latter space as a Chow quotient, Hilbert quotient, and so on, all have counterparts for complete collineations.   This analogy encompasses Vainsencher's construction of the complete collineations, as well as a form of the Gel'fand-MacPherson correspondence. There is also a tangential relation with the Gromov-Witten invariants of Grassmannians. The symmetric and anti-symmetric versions of the problem are considered as well.   An appendix explains the original motivation, which came from the space of broken Morse flows for the moment map of a circle action.
The main message of the paper is that for Gorenstein singularities, whose (real) link is rational homology sphere, the Artin--Laufer program can be continued. Here we give the complete answer in the case of elliptic singularities. The main result of the paper says that in the case of an elliptic Gorenstein singularity whose link is rational homology sphere, the geometric genus is a topological invariant. Actually, it is exactly the length of the elliptic sequence in the minimal resolution (or, equivalently, in S. S.-T. Yau's terminology: these singularities are maximally elliptic). In the paper we characterize the singularities with this property, and we compute their Hilbert-Samuel function from their resolution graph (generalizing some results of Laufer and Yau). The obstruction for a normal surface singularity to be maximally elliptic can be connected with the torsion part of some Picard groups, this is the new idea of the paper.
In this paper we study the \'etale cohomology groups associated to abelian varieties. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for an abelian variety to have semistable reduction (or purely additive reduction which becomes semistable over a quadratic extension) in terms of the action of the absolute inertia group on the \'etale cohomology groups with finite coefficients.
This is the abstruct of the revised paper. We study the equivariant analytic torsion for K3 surfaces with an anti-symplectic involution with the invariant lattice M (such a surface is called a 2-elementary K3 surface of type M in this paper), and show that it (together with the analytic torsion of the fixed curves) can be identified with the automorphic form on the moduli space characterizing the discriminant locus. Three lattices A_1, II_{1,1}(2), II_{1,9}(2) are of particular interest, because they consist of the building blocks of 2-elementary lattices. An explicit formula is given for them. In particular, if M is twice the Enriques lattice, the automorphic form coincides with Borcherds's Phi-function which confirms an observation by Jorgenson-Todorov and Harvey-Moore. Some other examples are shown to be related to Borcherds's product and generalized Kac-Moody algebras.
It is proved that a three-dimensional double cone is a birationally rigid variety. We also compute the group of birational automorphisms of such a variety. This work is based on the method of "untwisting" maximal singularities of linear system.
Using toric geometry, lattice theory, and elliptic surface techniques, we compute the Picard Lattice of certain K3 surfaces. In particular, we examine the generic member of each of M. Reid's list of 95 families of Gorenstein K3 surfaces which occur as hypersurfaces in weighted projective 3-spaces. The results appear in a multipage table near the end of the paper. As an application, we are able to determine whether the mirror family (in the sense of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces) for each one is also on Reid's list.
We characterize the subscheme of the moduli space of torsion-free sheaves on an elliptic surface which are stable of relative degree zeero (with respect to a polarization of type aH+bf, H being the section and f the elliptic fibre) which is isomorphic, via the relative Fourier-Mukai transform, with the relative compactified Simpson Jacobian of the family of those curves D in the surface which are flat over the base of the elliptic fibration. This generalizes and completes earlier constructions due to Friedman, Morgan and Witten. We also study the relative moduli scheme of sheaves whose restriction to each fibre is torsion-free and semistable of rank n and degree zero for higher dimensional elliptic fibrations. The relative Fourier-Mukai transform induces an isomorphic between this relative moduli space and the relative n-th symmetric product of the fibration.
Let X be a compact Kaehler manifold. We expect that any direct sum decomposition of the tangent bundle T(X) comes from a splitting of the universal covering space of X as a product of manifolds, in such a way that the given decomposition of T(X) lifts to the canonical decomposition of the tangent bundle of a product. We prove this assertion when X is a Kaehler-Einstein manifold or a Kaehler surface. Simple examples show that the Kaehler hypothesis is necessary.
We construct a family of plane curves as pull-backs of a conic for abelian coverings of P^2. If the conic is tangent to the ramification lines one obtains a family of curves of degree 2n with 3n singularities of type A_{n-1}. We calculate the fundamental group and Alexander polynomial for any member of this family and for some deformations of it.
This paper investigates the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the generic hyperplane section of projective curves in positive characteristic case, and yields an application to a sharp bound on the regularity for nondegenerate projective varieties.
In this paper, we contribute toward a classification of two-variable polynomials by classifying (up to an automorphism of $C^2$) polynomials whose Newton polygon is either a triangle or a line segment. Our classification has several applications to the study of embeddings of algebraic curves in the plane. In particular, we show that for any $k \ge 2$, there is an irreducible curve with one place at infinity, which has at least $k$ inequivalent embeddings in $C^2$. Also, upon combining our method with a well-known theorem of Zaidenberg and Lin, we show that one can decide "almost" just by inspection whether or not a polynomial fiber is an irreducible simply connected curve.
We test numerically the refined Manin's conjecture about the asymptotics of points of bounded height on Fano varieties for some diagonal cubic surfaces.
For ample vector bundles $E$ over compact complex varieties $X$ and a Schur functor $S_I$ corresponding to an arbitrary partition $I$ of the integer $|I|$, one would like to know the optimal vanishing theorem for the cohomology groups $H^{p,q}(X, S_I(E))$, depending on the rank of $E$ and the dimension $n$ of $X$.   Three years ago (Nov. 1995), in an unpublished paper one of us (W.N.) proved a vanishing theorem for the situation where the partition $I$ is a hook.   Here we give a simpler proof of this theorem. We also treat the same problem under weaker positivity assumptions, in particular under the hypothesis of ample $\Lambda ^m E$ with $m\in \N^*$. In this case we also need some bound on the weight $|I|$ of the partition. Moreover, we prove that the same vanishing condition applies for $H^{q,p}(X, S_I(E))$, with $p,q$ interchanged.

We examine the finite group actions on K3 and Abelian surfaces giving the same orbit space after desingularization. We show that when the group is not Z_2, then the Picard number of the K3 surface must be 19 or 20, and that in the latter case the Abelian surface is uniquely determined by the K3 surface.
We review some recent development on the extension problem of pluricanonical forms from a divisor to the ambient space in [Si], [K5] and [N3] with simplified proofs.
Mirror Symmetry for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties is by now well established. However, previous approaches to it did not uncover the underlying reason for mirror varieties to be mirror. We are able to calculate explicitly vertex algebras that correspond to holomorphic parts of A and B models of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and complete intersections in toric varieties. We establish the relation between these vertex algebras for mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds. This should eventually allow us to rewrite the whole story of toric Mirror Symmetry in the language of sheaves of vertex algebras. Our approach is purely algebraic and involves simple techniques from toric geometry and homological algebra, as well as some basic results of the theory of vertex algebras. Ideas of this paper may also be useful in other problems related to maps from curves to algebraic varieties. This paper could also be of interest to physicists, because it contains explicit descriptions of A and B models of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and complete intersection in terms of free bosons and fermions.
Nagata has conjectured that the following statement (N_r) holds for all $r\geq 10$: (N_r) if $P_1,...P_r \in {\mathbb P}^2$ are generic points then any plane curve $C$ satisfies $\sum_1^r mult_{P_i}(C)\leq \sqrt{r} deg(C)$. Nagata proved (N_r) whenever $r$ is a perfect square. Here we prove (N_r) provided $r=k^2+\alpha,1\leq\alpha\leq2k,k\geq 3$ and either (i) $\alpha$ is odd and $\alpha\geq \sqrt{2k}$ or (ii) $\alpha$ is even and at lest 6, and the fractional part of $\sqrt{r}$ is at most $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$.
Let $X$ be a projective curve of genus 2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. The Frobenius map on X induces a rational map on the moduli space of rank-2 bundles. We show that up to isomorphism, there is only one (up to tensoring by an order two line bundle) semi-stable vector bundle of rank 2 with determinant equal to a theta characteristic whose Frobenius pull-back is not stable. The indeterminacy of the Frobenius map at this point can be resolved by introducing Higgs bundles.
We give a condition for an exact functor between triangulated categories to be an equivalence. Applications to Fourier-Mukai transforms are discussed. In particular, we obtain a large number of such transforms for K3 surfaces.
This paper studies the Hilbert scheme of a curve on a complete-intersection K-trivial threefold, in the case in which the curve is unobstructed in the ambient variety in which the threefold lives. The basic result is that the obstruction theory of the curve is completely determined by the scheme-theoretic Abel-Jacobi mapping. Several applications of this fact are given.
We show that the number of generators of the n-th cotangent cohomology group (n >=2) is the same for all rational surface singularities Y. For a large class of rational surface singularities, including quotient singularities, this number is also the dimension. For them we obtain an explicit formula for the corresponding Poincare series.
This article treats various aspects of the geometry of the moduli of r-spin curves and its compactification. Generalized spin curves, or r-spin curves, are a natural generalization of 2-spin curves (algebraic curves with a theta-characteristic), and have been of interest lately because of the similarities between the intersection theory of these moduli spaces and that of the moduli of stable maps. In particular, these spaces are the subject of a remarkable conjecture of E. Witten relating their intersection theory to the Gelfand-Dikii (rth KdV) heirarchy. There is also a W-algebra conjecture for these spaces, analogous to the Virasoro conjecture of quantum cohomology.   We construct a smooth compactification of the stack of smooth r-spin curves, describe the geometric meaning of its points, and prove that it is projective. We also prove that when r is odd and g>1, the compactified stack of spin curves and its coarse moduli space are irreducible, and when r is even and g>1, the stack is the disjoint union of two irreducible components. We give similar results for n-pointed spin curves, as required for Witten's conjecture, and also generalize to the n-pointed case the classical fact that when g=1, the moduli of r-spin curves is the disjoint union of d(r) components, where d(r) is the number of positive divisors of r. These irreducibility properties are important in the study of the Picard group of the stack, and also in the study of the cohomological field theory related to Witten's conjecture (see math.AG/9905034).
The Abel-Jacobi map of the family of elliptic quintics lying on a general cubic threefold is studied. It is proved that it factors through a moduli component of stable rank 2 vector bundles on the cubic threefold with Chern numbers c_1=0, c_2=2, whose general point represents a vector bundle obtained by Serre's construction from an elliptic quintic. The elliptic quintics mapped to a point of the moduli space vary in a 5-dimensional projective space inside the Hilbert scheme of curves, and the map from the moduli space to the intermediate Jacobian is \'etale. As auxiliary results, the irreducibility of families of elliptic normal quintics and of rational normal quartics on a general cubic threefold is proved. This implies the uniqueness of the moduli component under consideration. The techniques of Clemens-Griffiths and Welters are used for the calculation of the infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map.
We establish a relation between intersection numbers of special cycles on a Shimura curve and special values of derivatives of metaplectic Eisenstein series at a place of bad reduction where p-adic uniformization in the sense of Cherednik and Drinfeld holds. The result extends the one established by one of us (S. Kudla: Ann. of Math. 146 (1997)) for the archimedean place and for the non-archimedean places of good reduction. The bulk of the paper is concerned with the corresponding problem on the Drinfeld upper half plane (the formal scheme version).
We prove a new bound for the Arakelov-Faltings height of an abelian variety over a function field of characteristic zero and relate it to inequalities of ABC-type as conjectured by Buium and Vojta.
For a double solid $V\to P_3(C)$ branched over a surface $B\subset P_3(C)$ with only ordinary nodes as singularities, we give a set of generators of the divisor class group $Pic(\tilde{V}})$ in terms of contact surfaces of $B$ with only superisolated singularities in the nodes of $B$. As an application we give a condition when the integral cohomology of $\tilde{V}$ has no 2-torsion. All possible cases are listed if $B$ is a quartic surface. Furthermore we give a new lower bound for the dimension of the code of $B$.
A proof of Petri's general conjecture on the unobstructedness of linear systems on a general curve is proposed, using only the local properties of the deformation space of the pair (curve, line bundle).
We prove an elementary but somewhat unexpected result about projective embeddings of smooth varieties X whose cotangent bundles are numerically effective. Specifically, we show that the degree of X in any projective embedding must grow (almost) exponentially in the dimension of X.
This paper gives a canonical construction, in terms of additive cohomological functors, of the universal formal deformation of a compact complex manifold without vector fields (more generally of a faithful $g$-module, where $g$ is a sheaf of Lie algebras without sections). The construction is based on a certain (multivariate) Jacobi complex $J(g)$ associatd to $g$: indeed ${\mathbb C}\oplus {\mathbb H}^0(J(g))^*$ is precisely the base ring of the universal deformation.
This paper is a sequel to math.AG/9810041 (whose abstract should have mentioned the fact that a version of the jacobi complex and higher-order Kodaira-Spencer maps were also discovered independently by Esnault and Viehweg). We give a canonical algebraic construction for the variation of Hodge structure associated to the universal m-th order deformation of a compact Kahler manifold without vector fields. Specializing to the case of a Calabi-Yau manifold, we give a formula for the mth derivative of its period map and deduce formal defining equations for the image (Schottky relations).
It is known that the smooth rational threefolds of P^5 having a rational non-special surface of P^4 as general hyperplane section have degree d=3,... ,7. We study such threefolds X from the point of view of linear systems of surfaces in P^3, looking in each case fosr an explicit description of a birational map from P^3 to X. For d=3,..., 6 we prove that there exists a line L on X such that the projection map of X centered at L is birational; we completely describe the base loci B of the linear systems found in this way and give a description of any such threefold X as a suitable blowing-down of the blowing-up of P^3 along B. If d=7, i.e. if X is a Palatini scroll, we prove that, conversely, a similar projection never exists.
In this paper we study formal moduli for wildly ramified Galois covering. We prove a local-global principle. We then focus on the infinitesimal deformations of the Z/pZ-covers. We explicitly compute a deformation of an automorphism of order p which implies a universal obstruction for p>2. By deforming Artin-Schreier equations we obtain a lower bound on the dimension of the local versal deformation ring. At last, by comparing the global versal deformation ring to the complete local ring in a point of a moduli space, we determine the dimensions of the global and local versal deformation ring.
This paper is devoted to the function introduced by M. P. Appell in connection with decomposition of elliptic functions of the third kind into simple elements. We show that this function (which appeared as a Fukaya triple product in math.AG/9803017) is related to global sections of rank-2 vector bundles on elliptic curves. We derive analogues of theta-identities for this function and prove the divisibility property for the action of modular group which should be considered as a replacement for functional equation.
In this paper we apply Shokurov's inductive method to study terminal and canonical singularities. As an easy consequence of the Minimal Model Program we show that for any three-dimensional log terminal singularity there exists some special, so called, plt blow-up. We discuss properties of them and construct some examples.
We prove that a projective contact manifold X with second Betti number at least 2 whose canonical bundle K_X is not nef, is always the projectivised tangent bundle P(T_Y) of a projective manifold Y. It is expected that the canonical bundle of a projective contact manifold is never nef; we prove this unless possibly K_X^2 = 0 and K_X is not numerically trivial. Moreover we study more generally nef subsheaves of rank 1 in the cotangent bundle which are proportional to the canonical bundle.
A Steiner bundle over the projective 3-space is the kernel in a trivial bundle of a morphism defined by a matrix of linear forms. We produce various Steiner bundles E of rank n such that E(1) has n-1 sections, the dependency locus of which is a smooth curve.
Let M(j) denote the moduli space of bundles on the blown-up plane which restrict to the exceptional divisor as O(j)+O(-j). We show that there is a topological embedding of M(j) into M(j+1).
In this paper we associate to t-motives with level structures a finite dimensional vector subspace (subspace of uniformizers). We study the particular case of elliptic sheaves finding some relations with some objects from conformal field theory.
(1,d)-polarized abelian surfaces in P^(d-1) with two plane cubic curve fibrations lie in two elliptic P^2-scrolls. The union of these scrolls form a reducible Calabi-Yau 3-fold. In this paper we show that this occurs when d<10 and analyse the family of such surfaces and 3-folds in detail when d=6. In particular, the reducible Calabi-Yau 3-folds deform in that case to irreducible ones with non-normal singularities.
The main outcome of this paper is that the variety VSP(F,10) of presentations of a general cubic form F in 6 variables as a sum of 10 cubes is a smooth symplectic 4-fold obtained a deformation of the Hilbert square of a K3 surface of genus 8. After publishing it in Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 353, No.4, 1455-1468 (2001), it was noted to us by Eyal Markman that in Theorem 3.17 we conclude without proof that VSP(F,10) should be the 4-fold of lines on another cubic 4-fold. We correct this in the e-print "Addendum to K3 surfaces of genus 8 and varieties of sums of powers of cubic fourfolds" (math.AG/0611533), where we establish that the general VSP(F,10) is in fact a new symplectic 4-fold different from the family of lines on a cubic 4-fold.
We give an explicit presentation with generators and relations of the quantum cohomology ring of the blow-up of a projective space along a linear subspace.
We extend results of our previous papers, on ordinary multiple points of curves, and on the computation of their conductor, to ordinary multiple subvarieties of codimension one.
We construct an algebraic homology functor for Artin stacks of finite type over a field, and we develop intersection-theoretic properties.
Let S(g,N,p) be the Siegel modular variety of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g with a \Gamma_0(p)-level structure and a full N-level structure (where p is a prime not dividing N \geq 3 and \Gamma_0(p) is the inverse image of a Borel subgroup of Sp(2g,F_p) in Sp(2g,Z)). This variety has a natural integral model over Z[1/N] which is not semi-stable over the prime p if g>1.   Using the theory of local models of Rapoport-Zink, we construct a semi-stable model of S(g,N,p) over Z[1/N] for g=2 and g=3.   For g=2, our construction differs from de Jong's one though the resulting model is the same.
Let (P,X) be Shimura data, M=M(P,X,K) the Shimura variety of level K. To an algebraic representation of P, one can associate a mixed sheaf (variation of Hodge structure, l-adic sheaf) on M. In the paper, we study the degeneration of such sheaves along strata in toroidal compactifications of M. The main result (2.8 in the Hodge setting, 3.9 in the l-adic setting) gives a formula for this degeneration in terms of Hochschild cohomology of certain unipotent subgroups of P. The new version differs from the earlier one in that the proof of 2.8 was rewritten. In particular, the effect of Saito's specialization functor along a stratum is identified on variations obtained via representations.
We consider normal projective n-dimensional varieties X whose anticanonical divisor class -K is ample and where every Weil divisor is a rational multiple of K. The index i is the largest integer such that K/i exists as a Weil divisor.  We show (i) if X has log-terminal singularities, and in addition 1-forms on the smooth part of X are holomorphic on a resolution, then (-K)^n =< (max(in,n+1))^n; (ii) if the tangent sheaf of X is semistable, then (-K)^n =<(2n)^n. The proof is based on some elementary but possibly surprising slope estimates on sheaves of differential operators on plurianticanonical sheaves. Unlike previous arguments in the smooth case (Nadel, Campana, Kollar-Miyaoka-Mori), rational curves and rational connectedness are not used.
We construct a version of Fourier transform for families of real tori. This transform defines a functor from certain category associated with a symplectic family of tori to the category of holomorphic vector bundles on the dual family (the dual family has a natural complex structure). In the 1-dimensional case the former category is closely related to the Fukaya category.
A formula for the generating function of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of pointed curves that is identical to the genus expansion of the free energy in two dimensional gravity is obtained. The contribution of arbitrary genus is expressed in terms of the Bessel function $J_0$.
We present a method to compute the holonomic extension of a $D$-module from a Zariski open set in affine space to the whole space. A particular application is the localization of coherent $D$-modules which are holonomic on the complement of an affine variety.
Let $V_1$ be the Fano threefold given as a hypersurface of degree 6 in $P(1,1,1,2,3)$ (over a number field $K$). Then there exists a finite extension $K'/K$ such that the set of $K'$-rational points of $X$ is Zariski dense.
Let $X$ be a projective variety with an action of a reductive group $G$. Each ample $G$-line bundle $L$ on $X$ defines an open subset $X^{\rm ss}(L)$ of semi-stable points. Following Dolgachev and Hu, define a GIT-class as the set of algebraic equivalence classes of $L'$s with fixed $X^{\rm ss}(L)$. We show that the GIT-classes are the relative interiors of rational polyhedral convex cones, which form a fan in the $G$-ample cone. We also study the corresponding variations of quotients $X^{\rm ss}(L)//G$. This sharpens results of Thaddeus and Dolgachev-Hu.
This note is but a research announcement, summarizing and explaining results proven and detailed in forthcoming papers. When one studies families of objects over curves, and the objects are parametrized by a Deligne-Mumford stack M, then the families are equivalent to morphisms of curves into M. In order to have complete moduli for such families, one needs to compactify the stack of stable maps into M. It turns out that in the boundary, the curve must acquire extra structure and you'd better read the paper to see what that structure is.   Applications to fibered surfaces (see math.AG/9804097), admissible covers, and level structures are discussed.
Let $X$ be a smooth compact projective variety over $\mathbb C$.   Let $H^2(\pi_1(X),\mathbb R)^{1,1}$ be the intersection of $H^{1,1}(X,{\mathbb R})$ with the image of the map $H^2(\pi_1(X),{\mathbb R})\to H^2(X)$ induced by the classifying map $X\to B\pi_1(X)$. Let $NS(X)$ be the N\'eron-Severi group of $X$.   Let $[\omega]\in H^2(\pi_1(X),\mathbb R)^{1,1}+ NS(X)\otimes {\mathbb R}$. In this note, we prove that $[\omega]$ is the cohomology class of a K\"ahler metric if and only if for every $d$-dimensional reduced closed algebraic subvariety $Z\subset X$, $[\omega]^d.Z>0$.
Let X be a scroll over a rational surface. We construct a linear system of surfaces in P^3 yielding a birational map from P^3 to X. We apply this construction to the scrolls of Bordiga and Palatini.
The genus g of an F_{q^2}-maximal curve satisfies g=g_1:=q(q-1)/2 or g\le g_2:= [(q-1)^2/4]. Previously, such curves with g=g_1 or g=g_2, q odd, have been characterized up to isomorphism. Here it is shown that an F_{q^2}-maximal curve with genus g_2, q even, is F_{q^2}-isomorphic to the nonsingular model of the plane curve \sum_{i=1}^{t}y^{q/2^i}=x^{q+1}, q=2^t, provided that q/2 is a Weierstrass non-gap at some point of the curve.
We give a criterion for a continuous family of curves on a nodal $K$-trivial threefold $X_0$ to contribute geometrically rigid curves to a general smoothing of $X_0$. As an application, we prove the existence of geometrically rigid curves of arbitrary degree and explicitly bounded genus on general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds.
We study Fourier-Mukai transforms for smooth projective varieties whose canonical bundles have finite order, and relate them to equivariant transforms on certain finite covering spaces. Our results lead to new equivalences of derived categories for Enriques and bielliptic surfaces.
The main result in this paper is as follows: Let S be the branch curve (in the projective plan) of a generic projection of a Veronese surface. Then the fundamental group of the complement of S is an extension of a solvable group by a symmetric group. A group with the property mentioned above is ``almost solvable'' in the sense that it contains a solvable normal subgroup of finite index. This raises the question for which families of simply connected algebraic surfaces of general type is the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve of a generic projection to the complex plane an extension of a solvable group by a symmetric group?
Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n on which a simple Lie group G acts regularly and non trivially. Then X is not minimal in the sense of the Minimal Model Program. In the paper we work out a classification of X via the Minimal Model Program under the assumption that the dimension of X is small with the respect to the dimension of G. More precisely we classify all such X with n smaller or equal to (r_G +1), where r_G is the minimum codimension of the maximal parabolic subgroup of G (for instance r_{SL(m)}= m-1). We consider also the case when G = SL(3) and X is a smooth 4-fold on which G acts with an open orbit.
In this paper, we investigate the moduli of surfaces of general type admitting genus 2 fibrations with irregularity q = g_b + 1, where g_b >= 2 is the genus of the base. We prove that smooth fibrations are parametrized by a unique component in the moduli space. The same result applies to nonsmooth fibrations with special values of g_b. In the general case, we give a bound on the dimension of the corresponding connected components.
We prove that the Veronese embedding of P^n of degree d with n\ge 2, d\ge 3 does not satisfy property N_p (according to Green and Lazarsfeld) if p\ge 3d-2.   We conjecture that the converse holds. This is true for n=2 and for n=d=3.
We show that the Fourier transform on the Jacobian of a curve interchanges "$\delta$ functions" at the curve and the theta divisor. The Torelli theorem is an immediate consequence.
Degenerate contributions to higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds are computed via Hodge integrals. The vanishing of contributions of covers of elliptic curves conjectured by Gopakumar and Vafa is proven. A formula for degree 1 covers for all genus pairs is computed in agreement with M-theoretic calculations of Gopakumar and Vafa. Finally, these results lead to a proof of a formula in the tautological ring of the moduli space of curves previously conjectured by Faber.
We use basic algebraic topology and Ellingsrud-Stromme results on the Betti numbers of punctual Hilbert schemes of surfaces to compute a generating function for the Euler characteristic numbers of the Douady spaces of "n-points" associated with a complex surface. The projective case was first proved by L. G\"ottsche.
A proof based on reduction to finite fields of Esnault-Viehweg's stronger version of Sommese Vanishing Theorem for $k$-ample line bundles is given. This result is used to give different proofs of isotriviality results of A. Parshin and L. Migliorini.
This paper is devoted to the study of the gluing construction for perverse sheaves on $G/U$ introduced by Kazhdan and Laumon ($G$ is a semisimple gourp, $U$ is the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup in $G$). Kazhdan and Laumon conjectured that all Ext-groups in the glued category are finite-dimensional and that global cohomological dimension is finite. We prove the first part of this conjecture. In the appendix we show that the simple object in the glued category corresponding to the constant sheaf has infinite cohomological dimension, thus disproving the second part of the above conjecture.
We prove that a standard realization of the direct image complex via the so-called Douady-Barlet morphism associated with a smooth complex analytic surface admits a natural decomposition in the form of an injective quasi-isomorphism of complexes. This is a more precise form of a special case of the decomposition theorems of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber and M. Saito.   The proof hinges on the special case of the bi-disk in the complex affine plane where we make explicit use of a construction of Nakajima's and of the corresponding representation-theoretic interpretation foreseen by Vafa-Witten. Some consequences of the decomposition theorem: G\"ottsche Formula holds for complex surfaces; interpretation of the rational cohomologies of Douady spaces as a kind of Fock space; new proofs of results of Brian\c{c}on and Ellingsrud-Stromme on punctual Hilbert schemes; computation of the mixed Hodge structure of the Douady spaces in the K\"ahler case. We also derive a natural connection with Equivariant K-Theory for which, in the case of algebraic surfaces, Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg have proposed a different approach.
In this paper we extend the properties of ordinary points of curves [10] to ordinary closed points of one-dimensional affine reduced schemes and then to ordinary subvarieties of codimension one.
This paper develops the theory of a sheaf of normal differential operators to a submanifold Y of a complex manifold X as a generalization of the normal bundle. We show that the global sections of this sheaf play an analogous role for formal deformations of Y to the role played by the normal bundle with respect to first-order deformations.
We work out the notion of mirror symmetry for abelian varieties and study its properties. Our construction are based on the correspondence between two $Q$--algebraic groups. One is the Hodge (or special Mumford--Tate) group. The second group $\bar{Spin(A)}$ is defined as follows: the group of autoequivalences of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves acts on the total cohomology $H(A,Q)$ of an abelian variety $A$ via algebraic correspondences. The group $\bar{Spin(A)}$ is now the Zariski closure of its image in $GL(H(A,Q))$. Our constructions are compatible with the picture of mirror symmetry sketched by Kontsevich, Morrison, and others.
We describe the derived category of coherent sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity associated to a finite subgroup G of SL(2). Then, we give an application to the Euler-characteristic version of the Hall algebra of the category of coherent sheaves on an algebraic surface.
The characteristic numbers of smooth plane quartics are computed using intersection theory on a component of the moduli space of stable maps. This completes the verification of Zeuthen's prediction of characteristic numbers of smooth plane curves. A short sketch of a computation of the characteristic numbers of plane cubics is also given as an illustration.
Sergey Pinchuk discovered a class of pairs of real polynomials in two variables that have a nowhere vanishing Jacobian determinant and define maps of the real plane to itself that are not one-to-one. This paper describes the asymptotic behavior of one specific map in that class. The level of detail presented permits a good geometric visualization of the map. Errors in an earlier description of the image of the map are corrected (the complement of the image consists of two, not four, points). Techniques due to Ronen Peretz are used to verify the description of the asymptotic variety of the map.
The category of unital (unbounded) dg cocommutative coalgebras over a field of characteristic zero is provided with a structure of simplicial closed model category. This generalizes the model structure defined by Quillen in 1969 for 2-reduced coalgebras. In our case, the notion of weak equivalence is structly stronger than that of quasi-isomorphism. A pair of adjoint functors connecting the category of coalgebras with the category of dg Lie algebras, induces an equivalence of the corresponding homotopy categories.   The model category structure allows one to consider dg coalgebras as very general formal stacks. The corresponding Lie algebra is then interpreted as a tangent Lie algebra which defines the formal stack uniquely up to a weak equivalence.   An example of the coalgebra of formal deformaions of a principal $G$-bundle on a scheme $X$ is calculated.
We present a new class of examples of base points for the generalized theta divisor on the moduli space of semistable vector bundles of trivial determinant on a compact Riemann surface and we prove that for sufficiently large rank the base locus is positive dimensional.
We proved that every rational curves in the primitive class of a general K3 surface of any genus is nodal.
Given a smooth projective variety $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we consider the composition of the de Rham cohomology cycle class map over $k$ from the Chow group $CH^q(X\times_kK)$, where $K$ is the field of fractions of henselization $A^h$ of the local ring of a smooth closed point of a variety over the field $k$ with an appropriate projection: $CH^q(X\times_kK)\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{p=1}^qgr_F^{q-p}N^{q-p} H^{2q-p}_{dR/k}(X)\otimes_k\Omega^p_{A^h/k,{\rm closed}},$ where $F^{\bullet}$ and $N^{\bullet}$ are the Hodge and the coniveau filtrations on the de Rham cohomology, respectively. The classical Abel--Jacobi map corresponds to the composition of this homomorphism with the projection to the summand $p=1$.   This homomorphism is not injective, however, its composition with the embedding into the space $\bigoplus_{p=1}^qgr_F^{q-p}N^{q-p}H^{2q-p}_{dR/k}(X)\otimes_k \lim_{\longleftarrow_M}d(\Omega^{p-1}_{A_M/k}),$ where $A_M=A^h/{\frak m}^M$ and ${\frak m}$ is the maximal ideal, is dominant for any $q$ for which the inverse Lefschetz operator $H^{2\dim X-q}(X)(\dim X)\stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow}H^q(X)(q)$ is induced by a correspondence.
We prove Lefschetz type theorems for cohomology groups and Picard groups of degeneracy loci for vector bundle maps. We also treat the case of antisymmetric maps.
We consider algebraic actions of a cyclic group of order p on a K3 surface defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. We classify possible loci of fixed points as well as possible quotient surfaces.
We introduce a class extending the notion of Chern-Mather class to possibly nonreduced schemes, and use it to express the difference between Schwartz-MacPherson's Chern class and the class of the virtual tangent bundle of a singular hypersurface of a nonsingular variety. Applications include constraints on the possible singularities of a hypersurface and on contacts of nonsingular hypersurfaces, and multiplicity computations.
We describe the embedded resolution of a quasi-ordinary surface singularity (V,p) which results from applying the canonical resolution of Bierstone-Milman to (V,p). We show that this process depends solely on the characteristic pairs of (V,p), as predicted by Lipman. We describe the process explicitly enough that a resolution graph for (V,p) could in principle be obtained by computer using only the characteristic pairs.
Let X be a complex algebraic variety, and L(X) be the scheme of formal arcs in X. Let f be an arc whose image is not contained in the singularities of X. We show that the formal neighborhood of f in L(X) admits a decomposition into a product of an infinite-dimensional smooth piece, and a piece isomorphic to the formal neighborhood of a closed point of a scheme of finite type.
We show, among other things, that in most cases the gonality of a subcanonical curve in projective-three space is computable by multisecants.
The subject of this paper is a Jacobian, introduced by F. Lazzeri, (unpublished), associated to every compact oriented riemannian manifold of dimension twice an odd number. We start the investigation of Torelli type problems and Schottky type problem for Lazzeri's Jacobian; in particular we examine the case of tori with flat metrics. Besides we study Lazzeri's Jacobian for Kahler manifolds and its relationship with other Jacobians. Finally we examine Lazzeri's Jacobian of a bundle.
In this paper, some particular rational maps P_n ---> P_n+1, called quadratic congruences, are studied. They appear in the theory of exceptional vector bundles on projective spaces.
We generalize the result of Kawamata concerning the strong version of Fujita's freeness conjecture for smooth 3-folds to some singular cases, namely, Gorenstein terminal singularities and quotient singularities of type 1/r(1,1,1) and of type 1/r(1,1,-1). We generalize furthermore the result of that to projective threefolds with only canonical singularities for canonical and not terminal singularities. It turns out that the estimates in the first three cases are better than the one for the smooth case, which it is not in the fourth case. We also give explicit examples which show the estimate in the fourth case is necessarily worse than the one for the smooth case.
Improvements in the exposition.
We study the geometry and cohomology of semiample hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Such hypersurfaces generalize the MPCP-desingularizations of Calabi-Yau ample hypersurfaces in the Batyrev mirror construction. We study the topological cup product on the middle cohomology of semiample hypersurfaces. In particular, we obtain a complete algebraic description of the middle cohomology of regular semiample hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional simplicial toric varieties what would be interesting for physics.
We consider $K_X$-negative extremal contractions $f\colon X\to (Z,o)$, where $X$ is an algebraic threefold with only $\epsilon$-log terminal Q-factorial singularities and $(Z,o)$ is a two (resp., one)-dimensional germ. The main result is that $K_X$ is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6-complementary or we have, so called, exceptional case and then the singularity $(Z\in o)$ is bounded (resp., the multiplicity of the central fiber $f^{-1}(o)$ is bounded).
We construct a version of Fourier transform for a class of non-commutative algebras over abelian varieties which include algebras of twisted differential operators generalizing the previous construction of Laumon (alg-geom/9603004) and of the second author (alg-geom/9602023). We also construct the microlocal version of this transform and its etale localization in the framework of Kapranov's theory of NC-schemes (see math.AG/9802041).
We study two components of the boundary of the compactification of the variety I_3 of instantons of degree three. We use the desciption of I_3 as symetric (involutive) cubo-cubic transforms deduced from the Beilinson monade. It involves some geometry of curves and surfaces in P^3. This allows us to distinguish two irreducible components which are in the closure of involutive cubo-cubic transforms. It gives us two irreducible components of the boundary of I_3. Moreover, we show that the cubo-cubic transforms of one of these components are the inverse of the other one.
We consider a possibility of the existence of intersection homology morphism, which would be associated to a map of analytic varieties. We assume that the map is an inclusion of codimension one. Then the existence of a morphism follows from Saito's decomposition theorem. For varieties with conical singularities we show, that the existence of intersection homology morphism is exactly equivalent to the validity of Hard Lefschetz Theorem for links. For varieties with arbitrary analytic singularities we extract a remarkable property, which we call Local Hard Lefschetz.
Periods of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces were computed by Mukai, O'Grady and the author. In this paper, we shall treat moduli spaces of stable sheaves on abelian surfaces.
Let X be a smooth, projective variety defined over a local field K. Following Manin, two K-points of X are called R-equivalent if they can be joined by a rational curve defined over K. The main result of this note shows that if there are only finitely many R-equivalence classes over the algebraic closure of K then the same holds over K. This also yields the unirationality of several classes of varieties over K.
This is the fourth of a series of papers studying real algebraic threefolds, but the methods are mostly independent from the previous ones. Let $f:X\to C$ be a map of a smooth projective real algebraic 3-fold to a curve $C$ whose general fibers are rational surfaces.   Assume that the set of real points of $X$ is an orientable 3-manifold $M$. The aim of the paper is to give a topological description of $M$.
We construct an $A_{\infty}$-structure on the Ext-groups of hermitian holomorphic vector bundles on a compact complex manifold. We propose a generalization of the homological mirror conjecture due to Kontsevich. Namely, we conjecture that for mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds $M$ and $X$ there exists an $A_{\infty}$-functor from Fukaya's symplectic $A_{\infty}$-category of $M$ to the $A_{\infty}$-derived category of $X$ which is a homotopy equivalence on morphisms. We verify the part of this conjecture concering triple products for elliptic curves.
This paper aims to study canonical pencils of higher dimensional projective varieties. It seems that the geometric genus of the general fibre for the derived fibration from the canonical pencil for a 3-fold of general type does not have an upper bound.
This paper proves that the 5-canonical map of a smooth minimal 3-fold is birational when the geometric genus is bigger than 2. A combination of the results in this paper and that of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Lee, the possible exceptional cases are very limited. Unfortunately, no counter examples have been found up to now.
In this paper, we will list up all the cases for the ray contractions of divisorial and fiber types for smooth projective varieties of dimension five. These are obtained as a corollary from the lists of n-dimensional k-th adjoint contractions f: X -> Y of the same types for k=1,2,3 and 4 (n> or =5). The lists for k=1,2 and 3 have previously been obtained in [Na], Proposition 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. The main task will be to have such a list for k=4, where one case in the list fails to show that a positive-dimensional general fiber F of f is irreducible when n>5. This assertion will, however, be proven when n=5 with an essential aid of 3-dimensional Minimal Model Program in [Mo2]. (We do not show the existence of cases.)
In this paper we show that any hypersurface singularities of germs of varieties in positive characteristic can be resolved by iterated monoidal transformations in centers in smooth subvarieties, if we have a valuation ring of iterated divisor type associated with the germ. Besides, we introduce fundamental concepts for the study of resolution of singularities of germs such as space germs, iterated analytic monoidal transformations with a normal crossing, Weierstrass representations, reduction sequences, and so forth.
Using the data schemes developed by Arrondo-Sols-Speiser, we give a rigorous definition of algebraic differential equations on the complex projective space $P^n$. For an algebraic subvariety $S \subseteq P^n$, we present an explicit formula for the degree of the divisor of solutions of a differential equation on $S$ and give some examples of applications. We extend the technique and result to the real case.
This paper is a sequel to math.AG/9803041. It consists of three parts. In the first part we give certain construction of vertex algebras which includes in particular the ones appearing in op. cit.   In the second part we show how the cohomology ring $H^*(X)$ of a smooth complex variety $X$ could be restored from the correlation functions of the vertex algebra $R\Gamma(X;\Omega^{ch}_X)$.   In the third part, we prove first a useful general statement that the sheaf of loop algebras over the tangent sheaf $\Cal{T}_X$ acts naturally on $\Omega^{ch}_X$ for every smooth $X$ (see \S 1). The Z-graded vertex algebra $H^*(X;\Omega^{ch}_X)$ seems to be a quite interesting object (especially for compact $X$). In \S 2, we compute $H^0(CP^N;\Omega^{ch}_{CP^N})$ as a module over $\hat{sl}(N+1)$.
Components of the Moduli space of sheaves on a K3 surface are parametrized by a lattice; the (algebraic) Mukai lattice. Isometries of the Mukai lattice often lift to symplectic birational isomorphisms of the collection of components. An example of such a birational isomorphism is the Abel-Jacobi map relating the Hilbert scheme of g points on a K3 of degree 2g-2 to an integrable system: the union of Jacobians of hyperplane sections (curves) of genus g. The main results are:   1) We construct a stratified version of a Mukai elementary transformation modeled after dual pairs of Springer resolutions of nilpotent orbits. It applies to a holomorphic-symplectic variety M with a stratification where the first stratum is a P^n bundle, but lower strata are Grassmannian bundles. The resulting (transformed) symplectic variety W admits a stratification by the dual Grassmannian bundles.   2) The group of reflections of the Mukai lattice, which act trivially on the second cohomology of the K3 surface, acts on moduli spaces of sheaves (with ``minimal'' first Chern class) as birational stratified elementary transformations.   3) We derive a Picard-Lefschetz type formula identifying the isomorphism of cohomology rings of a holomorphic-symplectic variety M and its stratified transform W as the cup product with an algebraic correspondence.
Let C(X) be the algebra generated by the curvature 2-forms of the standard hermitian line bundles over the complex homogeneous manifold X=G/B. We calculate the Hilbert polynomial of C(X) and give its presentation as a quotient of a polynomial ring. In particular, we show the dimension of C(X) is equal to the number of independent subsets of roots in the corresponding root system. As a tool we study a more general algebra associated with a point on a Grassmannian and calculate its Hilbert polynomial as well as its presentation in terms of generators and relations.
Birational Calabi-Yau threefolds in the same deformation family provide a `weak' counterexample to the global Torelli problem, as long as they are not isomorphic. In this paper, it is shown that deformations of certain desingularized weighted complete intersections provide examples of families containing birational varieties. The constructed examples are shown to be non-isomorphic using a specialization argument.
We first classify the possible configurations of fibrations which are not semi-stable on extremal elliptic K3 surfaces. Then we give a complete list of extremal elliptic K3 surfaces whose singular fibers are all not of type $I_n$.
Let W be a projective variety of dimension n+1, L a free line bundle on W, X in $H^0(L^d)$ a hypersurface of degree d which is generic among those given by sums of monomials from $L$, and let $f : Y \to X$ be a generically finite map from a smooth m-fold Y. We suppose that f is r-filling, i.e. upon deforming X in $H^0(L^d)$, f deforms in a family such that the corresponding deformations of $Y^r$ dominate $W^r$. Under these hypotheses we give a lower bound for the dimension of a certain linear system on the Cartesian product $Y^r$ having certain vanishing order on a diagonal locus as well as on a double point locus. This yields as one application a lower bound on the dimension of the linear system |K_{Y} - (d - n + m)f^*L - f^*K_{W}| which generalizes results of Ein and Xu (and in weaker form, Voisin). As another perhaps more surprising application, we conclude a lower bound on the number of quadrics containing certain projective images of Y.
The principle "ambient cohomology of a Kaehler manifold annihilates obstructions" has been known and exploited since pioneering work of Kodaira. This paper extends and unifies many known results in two contexts, abstract deformations of compact Kaehler manifolds and deformations of submanifolds within a given deformation of the ambient manifold.
The contact structure of two meromorphic curves gives a factorization of their jacobian.
In this paper we study Hodge classes on complex abelian varieties. We prove some general results that allow us, in certain cases, to compute the Hodge group of a product abelian variety $X = X_1 \times X_2$ once we know the Hodge groups of the two factors. Using these results we can compute the Hodge groups of all abelian varieties of dimension $\leq 5$. We prove that the Hodge ring of any such abelian variety $X$ is generated by divisor classes together with the so-called Weil classes on (quotients of) $X$.
Paper withdrawn.   There is a gap in the proof of Proposition 4.3 (its conclusion ``d'o\`{u} la proposition.'' is incorrect). Therefore theorems 1.1 and 3.1, which were the main results of the paper, are not proved.
In this paper, we consider an arithmetic Hodge index theorem for a family of semi-stable curves f: X \to B with f_{\bf C} being smooth, generalizing Faltings-Hriljac's arithmetic Hodge index theorem for an arithmetic surface.
Let f:S ->B be a relatively minimal fibred surface. In this note we give a partial affirmative answer to a conjecture of Xiao, proving that the direct image of the relative dualizing sheaf of $f$ is ample when the slope of the fibration is less than 4, if the general fibre of $f$ is non-hyperelliptic or the genus of the fibre or of the base curve is low.
Given a relatively minimal non locally trivial fibred surface f: S->B, the slope of the fibration is a numerical invariant associated to the fibration. In this paper we explore how properties of the general fibre of $f$ and global properties of S influence on the lower bound of the slope. First of all we obtain lower bounds of the slope when the general fibre is a double cover. We also obtain a lower bound depending as an increasing function on the relative irregularity of the fibration, extending previous results of Xiao. We construct several families of examples to check the assimptotical sharpness of our bounds.
Nous montrons que le rev\^etement universel des vari\'et\'es alg\'ebriques projectives dont le fibr\'e tangent est totalement d\'ecompos\'e et v\'erifie certaines conditions d'int\'egrabilit\'e est produit de surfaces de Riemann et que la d\'ecomposition de $T_{X}$ est induite par la d\'ecomposition du tangent au rev\^etement universel; lorsque la vari\'et\'e est minimale les conditions d'int\'egrabilit\'e ne sont pas n\'ec\'essaires.
A necessary and sufficient condition is given for semi-ampleness of a numerically effective (nef) and big line bundle in positive characteristic. One application is to the geometry of the universal stable curve over M_g, specifically, the semi-ampleness of the relative dualizing sheaf, in positive characteristic. An example is given which shows this and the semi-ampleness criterion fail in characteristic zero. A second application is to Mori's program for minimal models of 3-folds in positive characteristic, namely, to the existence of birational extremal contractions.
In this paper we use Weil conjectures (Deligne's theorem) to calculate the Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of semi-stable parabolic bundles on a curve. The quasi parabolic analogue of the Siegel formula, together with the method of Harder-Narasimhan filtration gives us a recursive formula for the Poincar\'e polynomials of the moduli. We solve the recursive formula by the method of Zagier, to give the Poincar\'e polynomial in a closed form.  We also give explicit tables of Betti numbers in small rank, and genera.
Given a compact Riemann surface $\bar{X}$ of genus $g$ and a point $q$ on $\bar{X}$, we consider $X:=\bar{X}\setminus\{q\}$ with a basepoint $p\in X$. The extension of mixed Hodge structures, given by the weights -1 and -2, of the mixed Hodge structure on the fundamental group (in the sense of Hain) is studied. We show that it naturally corresponds on the one hand to the element $(2g q-2 p-K)$ in $\Pic^0(\bar{X})$, where $K$ represents the canonical divisor, and on the other hand to the respective extension of $\bar{X}$. Finally, we prove a pointed Torelli theorem for punctured Riemann surfaces.
We prove that the moduli space A_{11}^{lev} of (1,11) polarized abelian surfaces with level structure of canonical type is birational to Klein's cubic hypersurface:   a^2b+b^2c+c^2d+d^2e+e^2a=0 in P^4.   Therefore, A_{11}^{lev} is unirational but not rational, and there are no Gamma_{11}-cusp forms of weight 3. The same methods also provide an easy proof of the rationality of A_{9}^{lev}.
On a space of stable maps, the psi classes are modified by subtracting certain boundary divisors. The top products of modified psi classes, usual psi classes, and classes pulled back along the evaluation maps are called twisted descendants; it is shown that in genus 0, they admit a complete recursion and are determined by the Gromov-Witten invariants. One motivation for this construction is that all characteristic numbers (of rational curves) can be interpreted as twisted descendants; this is explained in the second part, using pointed tangency classes. As an example, some of Schubert's numbers of twisted cubics are verified.
After the appearance of my preprint [T3] (Special Lagrangian geometry and slightly deformed algebraic geometry (spLag and sdAG), Warwick preprint 22/1998, alg-geom/9806006, 54 pp.). I received an e-mail from Cumrun Vafa, who recognized that the subject is closely related to that of his preprint [V] (Extending mirror conjecture to Calabi-Yau with bundles, hep-th/9804131, 7 pp.). This text started out as an e-mail ``reply'' to his letter. All the constructions we propose have well known ``spectral curve'' prototypes (see for example Friedman and other [FMW], Bershadsky and other [BJPS] and a number of others). Roughly speaking, our constructions are the spectral curve construction plus the phase geometry described in [T3]. So this text should really come before [T3], as motivation for the development of the geometry of the phase map in [T3].
In this paper we study the map associating to a linear differential operator with rational coefficients its monodromy data. The operator has one regular and one irregular singularity of Poincare' rank 1. We compute the Poisson structure of the corresponding Monodromy Preserving Deformation Equations on the space of the monodromy data.
This paper aims to improve a theorem of Janos Kollar. For a given Complex projective threefold X of general type, suppose the plurigenus p_k(X)\ge 2, Kollar proved that the (11k+5)-canonical map is birational. Here we show that either the (7k+3)-canonical map or the (7k+5)-canonical map is birational and that the m-canonical map is stably birational for m\ge 13k+6. If P_k(X)\ge 3, then the m-canonical map is stably birational for m\ge 10k+8. In particular, the 12-canonical map is birational when p_g(X)\ge 2 and the 11-canonical map is birational when p_g(X)\ge 3.
We show that the generating function for the higher Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli spaces of stable curves with marked points can be obtained from Witten's free energy by a change of variables given by Schur polynomials. Since this generating function has a natural extension to the moduli space of invertible Cohomological Field Theories, this suggests the existence of a ``very large phase space'', correlation functions on which include Hodge integrals studied by C. Faber and R. Pandharipande. From this formula we derive an asymptotical expression for the Weil-Petersson volume as conjectured by C. Itzykson. We also discuss a topological interpretation of the genus expansion formula of Itzykson-Zuber, as well as a related bialgebra acting upon quantum cohomology as a complex version of the classical path groupoid.
We study a class of Calabi-Yau varieties that can be represented as a non-singular model of a double covering of $\mathbb P^3$ branched along certain octic surfaces. We compute Euler numbers of all constructed examples and describe their resolution of singularities.
Compactifications of moduli spaces of (1,p)-polarized abelian surfaces with level structures of canonical type have been described in great detail by Hulek, Kahn and Weintraub. The aim of this paper is to determine some invariants of smooth models of these moduli spaces. In particular, a geometric description of their canonical divisors is given and their Chern numbers are computed.
Equivariant compactifications of reductive groups can be described by combinatorial data. On the other hand, equivariant compactifications of the additive group G^n_a are more complicated in at least two respects. First, they often admit moduli. Second, even simple varieties (like projective spaces) admit many different structures as equivariant compactifications of the additive group. We give a dictionary relating Artinian local rings, certain systems of partial differential equations, and equivariant compactifications of G^n_a. As an application, we classify the structures on varieties like projective spaces, ruled surfaces, and certain threefolds. We consider these results as a first step in a systematic study of G^n_a-equivariant birational geometry.
In this paper we construct 206 examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds with different Euler numbers. All constructed examples are smooth models of double coverings of $P^3$ branched along an octic surface. We allow 11 types of (not necessary isolated) singularities in the branch locus. Thus we broaden the class of examples studied in math.AG/9902057. For every considered example we compute the Euler number and give a precise description of a resolution of singularities.
The purpose of this paper is to give two applications of Fourier transforms and generic vanishing theorems:   - we give a cohomological characterization of principal polarizations   - we prove that if $X$ an abelian variety and $\Theta $ a polarization of type $(1,...,1,2)$, then a general pair $(X,\Theta )$ is log canonical
We compute the convolution product on the equivariant K-groups of the cyclic quiver variety. We get a q-analogue of double-loop algebras, closely related to the toroidal quantum groups previously studied by the authors. We also give a geometric interpretation of the cyclic quiver variety in terms of equivariant torsion-free sheaves on the projective plane.
In this paper we find an explicit formula for the number of topologically different ramified coverings $C\to\CP^1$ (C is a compact Riemann surface of genus g) with only one complicated branching point in terms of Hodge integrals over the moduli space of genus g curves with marked points.
We give some examples of isomorphisms of moduli of sheaves induced by Fourier-Mukai functor. As applications, we give another proof on deformation type of some moduli spaces of sheaves on abelian and K3 surfaces.
This survey paper is devoted to Riemannian manifolds with special holonomy. To any Riemannian manifold of dimension n is associated a closed subgroup of SO(n), the holonomy group; this is one of the most basic invariants of the metric. A famous theorem of Berger gives a complete (and rather small) list of the groups which can appear. Surprisingly, the compact manifolds with holonomy smaller than SO(n) are all related in some way to Algebraic Geometry. This leads to the study of special algebraic varieties (Calabi-Yau, complex symplectic or complex contact manifolds) for which Riemannian geometry rises interesting questions.
Let $E$ be an ample vector bundle of rank $r$ on a projective variety $X$ with only log-terminal singularities. We consider the nefness of adjoint divisors $K_X+(t-r)det(E)$ when $t>=dim(X)$ and $t>r$. As a corollary, we classify pairs $(X,E)$ with $c_r$-sectional genus zero.
Let X be a complete complex nonsingular algebraic variety and D a closed algebraic subset of X. We show that the cup product maps H^i(X \setminus D) \otimes H^j(X,D) \to H^{i+j}(X,D) are morphisms of mixed Hodge structures. As a corollary we obtain a new proof of a duality result of Fujiki. We also deal with the extraordinary cup product.
Let $\cMx$ be the moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank $n\geq 3$ and determinant $\xi$ over a connected Riemann surface $X$, with $n$ and $d(\xi)$ coprime. Let $D$ be a Calabi-Yau hypersurface of $\cMx$. Denote by $U_D$ the restriction of the universal bundle to $X\times D$. It is shown that the restriction $(U_D)_x$ to $x\times D$ is stable, for any $x\in X$. Furthermore, for a general curve the connected component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves over $D$, containing $(U_D)_x$, is isomorphic to $X$. It is also shown that $U_D$ is stable for any polarisation, and the connected component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves over $X\times D$, containing $U_D$, is isomorphic to the Jacobian. Moreover, this is an isomorphism of polarised varieties, and hence such a moduli spaces determine the Reimann surface.
We prove abundance for a minimal Kaehler threefold which is not both simple and non-Kummer. Recall that a variety is simple if there is no compact subvariety of positive dimension through a sufficiently general point . Furthermore we prove that a smooth compact Kaehler threefold whose canonical bundle is not nef, carries a contraction unless (possibly) the manifold is simple non-Kummer. It is generally conjectured that simple threefolds must be Kummer.
We take the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve of a generic projection induced from canonical embedding of a surface. This group is stable on connected components of moduli spaces of surfaces. Since for many classes of surfaces it is expected that the fundamental group has a polycyclic structure, we define a new invariant that comes from this structure. We compute this invariant for a few examples. Braid monodromy factorizations related to curves is a first step in computing the fundamental group of the complement of the curve, and thus we also indicate the possibility of using braid monodromy factorizations of branch curves as an invariant of a surface.
Sergey Pinchuk found a polynomial map from the real plane to itself which is a local diffeomorphism but is not one-to-one. The aim of this paper is to give a geometric description of Pinchuk's map.
In 1899, Hutchinson presented a way to obtain a three-parameter family of Hessians of cubic surfaces as blowups of Kummer surfaces. We show that this family consists of those Hessians containing an extra class of conic curves. Based on this, we find the invariant of a cubic surface C in pentahedral form that vanishes if its Hessian is in Hutchinson's family, and we give an explicit map between cubic surfaces in pentahedral form and blowups of Kummer surfaces.
In this paper we treat some applications of Kawamata's positivity theorem. We get a weak answer to \cite [Section 3]{KeMaMc}. And we investigate the singularities on the target spaces of some morphisms.
Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a proper dlt pair and $L$ a nef Cartier divisor such that $aL-(K_X+\Delta)$ is nef and log big on $(X,\Delta)$ for some $a\in {\mathbb Z}_{>0}$. Then $|mL|$ is base point free for every $m\gg 0$.
We prove the birational boundedness of Q-Fano varieties with Picard number one and dimension $n$ for every $n$. We do not use Mori theory.
In this article we apply the classical method of focal loci of families to give a lower bound for the genus of curves lying on general surfaces. First we translate and reprove Xu's result that any curve C on a general surface in P^3 of degree d>4 has geometric genus g > 1 + deg(C)(d - 5)/2. Then we prove a similar lower bound for the curves lying on a general surface in a given component of the Noether-Lefschetz locus in P^3 and on a general projectively Cohen-Macaulay surface in P^4.
In this note, we prove that every fibre space structures of a projective irreducible symplectic manifold is a lagrangian fibration.
The purpose of this paper is to prove dimension formulas for $T^1$ and $T^2$ for rational surface singularities. These modules play an important role in the deformation theory of isolated singularities in analytic and algebraic geometry. The first may be identified as the Zariski tangent space of the versal deformation of the singularity; i.e. it is the space of infinitesimal deformations. The second contains the obstruction space -- in all known cases it is the whole obstruction space for rational surface singularities.
We discuss adjunction formulas for fiber spaces and embeddings, extending the known results along the lines of the Adjunction Conjecture, independently proposed by Y. Kawamata and V.V. Shokurov.   As an application, we simplify Koll\'ar's proof for the Anghern and Siu's quadratic bound in the Fujita's Conjecture. We also connect adjunction and its precise inverse to the problem of building isolated log canonical singularities.
In this paper, we prove the Effective Bogomolov's Conjecture for hyperelliptic curves defined over function fields.
We discuss a particular class of rational Gorenstein singularities, which we call symplectic. A normal variety V has symplectic singularities if its smooth part carries a closed symplectic 2-form whose pull-back in any resolution X --> V extends to a holomorphic 2-form on X . Our main result is the classification of isolated symplectic singularities with smooth projective tangent cone. They are in one-to-one correspondence with simple complex Lie algebras: to a Lie algebra g corresponds the singularity at 0 of the closure of the minimal (nonzero) nilpotent adjoint orbit in g .
Seshadri constants are local invariants, introduced by Demailly, which measure the local positivity of ample line bundles. Recent interest in Seshadri constants stems on the one hand from the fact that bounds on Seshadri constants yield, via vanishing theorems, bounds on the number of points and jets that adjoint linear series separate. On the other hand it has become increasingly clear by now that Seshadri constants are highly interesting invariants quite in their own right. Except in the simplest cases, however, they are already in the case of surfaces very hard to control or to compute explicitly---hardly any explicit values of Seshadri constants are known so far. The purpose of the present paper is to study these invariants on algebraic surfaces. On the one hand, we prove a number of explicit bounds for Seshadri constants and Seshadri submaximal curves, and on the other hand, we give complete results for abelian surfaces of Picard number one. A nice feature of this result is that it allows to explicitly compute the Seshadri constants---as well as the unique irreducible curve that accounts for it---for a whole class of surfaces. It also shows that Seshadri constants have an intriguing number-theoretic flavor in this case.
Let E,F be algebraic vector bundles on a projective algebraic variety. Let G=Aut(E)XAut(F), acting on W=Hom(E,F). In this paper new methods of construction of algebraic quotients of open G-invariant subsets of W are studied. This is done by associating to W a new space of morphisms W'=Hom(E',F') (with group G'=Aut(E')XAut(F')) in such a way that there is a natural bijection between the set of G-orbits of an open subset of W and the set of G'-orbits of an open subset of W'. We can then apply already known construction methods to G'-invariant open subsets of W' and deduce with the correspondance new quotients of open G-invariant subsets of W. This is a new version and a continuation of an older paper.
We prove that every place of an algebraic function field F|K of arbitrary characteristic admits local uniformization in a finite extension F' of F. We show that F'|F can be chosen to be normal. If K is perfect and P is of rank 1, then alternatively, F' can be obtained from F by at most two Galois extensions; if in addition P is zero-dimensional, then we only need one Galois extension. Certain rational places of rank 1 can be uniformized already on F. We introduce the notion of "relative uniformization" for arbitrary finitely generated extensions of valued fields. Our proofs are based solely on valuation theoretical theorems, which are of fundamental importance in positive characteristic.
An effective divisor D on a smooth (compact complex) surface X is called even, if its class $[D] \in H^2(X,\Z)$ is divisible by 2. D may be assumed reduced w.l.o.g. Then D being even is equivalent to the existence of a double cover $Y \to X$ branched exactly over D.   The aim of this note is to study arrangements of $n \leq 10$ distinct lines on a smooth quartic surface $X \subset \P_3$, which form an even divisor in this sense. The result is that for $n \leq 8$ there are no unexpected ones (one type of six lines, four types of eight lines). And for n=10 a partial classification is given in the following sense: Each even set of ten lines on a smooth quartic surface is of one of eleven different types. At the moment I do not know which of these types do actually occur. The proof for these facts is messy, essentially checking cases.
This paper contains a Kawamata-Viehweg-Koll\'ar type vanishing theorem for vector bundles. In order to formulate and prove this cleanly, we introduce a class of sheaves that automatically satisfies a vanishing theorem. This is obtained by closing up the subclass of sheaves of adjoint type under extensions, direct images, and taking direct summands.
This paper gives an introduction to Kuga-Satake varieties and discusses some aspects of the Hodge conjecture related to them. Kuga-Satake varieties are abelian varieties associated to certain weight two Hodge structures, for example the second cohomology group of a K3 surface. We give a detailed account of the construction of Kuga-Satake varieties and of their decomposition in simple subvarieties. We recall the Hodge conjecture and we point out a connection between the Hodge conjecture for abelian fourfolds and Kuga-Satake varieties. We discuss the implications of the Hodge conjecture on the geometry of surfaces whose second cohomology group has a Kuga-Satake variety. We conclude with some recent results on Kuga-Satake varieties of Hodge structures on which an imaginary quadratic field acts.
Let $V$ be a complex vector space on which a finite group $G$ acts by linear transformations. Let $W = V \oplus V^*$ be the sum of $V$ with its dual $V^*$. We prove that if the quotient $W/G$ admits a smooth crepant resolution, then the subgroup $G \subset Aut V$ is generated by complex reflections. We also obtain some results on the structure of smooth crepant resolutions of the quotients $W/G$, where $W$ is a symplectic vector space, and $G \subset Aut W$ is a finite group of symplectic linear transformations of the vector space $W$.
Let G be an algebraic group and let X be a generically free G-variety. We show that X can be transformed, by a sequence of blowups with smooth G-equivariant centers, into a G-variety X' with the following property: the stabilizer of every point of X' is isomorphic to a semidirect product of a unipotent group U and a diagonalizable group A.   As an application of this and related results, we prove new lower bounds on essential dimensions of some algebraic groups. We also show that certain polynomials in one variable cannot be simplified by a Tschirnhaus transformation.
In this paper we generalize to the non-abelian context a classical theorem of Griffiths which studies the behavior of the $(p,q)$-components of a horizontal section in a variation of Hodge structures over a smooth projective variety.
We study families V of curves in P^2 of degree d having exactly r singular points of given topological or analytic types. We derive new sufficient conditions for V to be T-smooth (smooth of the expected dimension), respectively to be irreducible. For T-smoothness these conditions involve new invariants of curve singularities and are conjectured to be asymptotically proper, i.e., optimal up to a constant factor. To obtain the results, we study the Castelnuovo function, prove the irreducibility of the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional schemes associated to a cluster of infinitely near points of the singularities and deduce new vanishing theorems for ideal sheaves of zero-dimensional schemes in P^2. Moreover, we give a series of examples of cuspidal curves where the family V is reducible, but where the fundamental groups of P^2 \ C coincide (and are abelian) for all C in V.
We give an example of geometric construction (via Hecke correspondences) of certain representations of the affine Lie algebra $\hat{gl}_n$. The construction is similar to the one of [FK] for the Lie algebra $sl_n$. Given a surface with a smooth embedded curve $C$ we consider the moduli spaces $K_\alpha$ of rank $n$ parabolic sheaves satisfying certain conditions. The top dimensional irreducible components of $K_\alpha$ are numbered by the isomorphism classes of $\alpha$-dimensional nilpotent representations of the cyclic quiver $\tilde{A}_{n-1}$. Summing up over all $\alpha\in{\Bbb N}[{\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}]$ we obtain a vector space $M$ with a basis of fundamental classes of top dimensional components of $K_\alpha$. The natural correspondences give rise to the action of Chevalley generators $e_i,f_i\in\hat{sl}_n$ on $M$. We compute explicitly the matrix coefficients of $e_i,f_i$ in the above basis. The central charge of $M$ depends on the genus of the curve $C$ and the degree of its normal bundle.
We prove that any smooth complex projective variety $X$ with plurigenera $P_1(X)=P_2(X)=1$ and irregularity $q(X)=dim (X)$ is birational to an abelian variety.
The present work is devoted to the study of motivic integration on quotient singularities. We give a new proof of a form of the McKay correspondence previously proved by Batyrev. The paper contains also some general results on motivic integration on arbitrary singular spaces.
We enumerate the singular algebraic curves in a complete linear system on a smooth projective surface. The system must be suitably ample in a rather precise sense. The curves may have up to eight nodes, or a triple point of a given type and up to three nodes. The curves must also pass through appropriately many general points. The number of curves is given by a universal polynomial in four basic Chern numbers.   To justify the enumeration, we make a rudimentary classification of the types of singularities using Enriques diagrams, obtaining results like Arnold's. We show that the curves in question do, in fact, appear with multiplicity 1 using the versal deformation space, Shustin's codimension formula, and Gotzmann's regularity theorem. Finally, we relate our work to Vainsencher's work with up to seven nodes.
We study the higher Abel-Jacobi invariant defined recently by M. Green. We first construct a counterexample to the injectivity of Green's higher Abel-Jacobi map.   On the other hand, we prove that the higher Abel-Jacobi map governs Mumford's pull-back of holomorphic forms. We deduce from this that if a surface has holomorphic 2-forms, the image of the higher Abel-Jacobi map, defined on its group of zero-cycles Albanese equivalent to 0, has infinite dimensional image.
Let $P \cup P'$ be the two component Prym variety associated to an \'etale double cover $\tilde{C} \to C$ of a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \geq 6$ and let $|2\Xi_0|$ and $|2\Xi_0'|$ be the linear systems of second order theta divisors on $P$ and $P'$ respectively. The component $P'$ contains canonically the Prym curve $\tilde{C}$. We show that the base locus of the subseries of divisors containing $\tilde{C} \subset P'$ is scheme-theoretically the curve $\tilde{C}$. We also prove canonical isomorphisms between some subseries of $|2\Xi_0|$ and $|2\Xi_0'|$ and some subseries of second order theta divisors on the Jacobian of $C$.
We provide supporting examples to Le Potier's Strange duality conjecture, in the case of the moduli space M of rank 2 semi-stable sheaves on the projective plane, with even first Chern class, and second Chern class less or equal to 19. We compute in this case the dimension of the space of global sections of the determinant bundle on M.
We compute the cohomology spaces for the tautological bundle tensor the determinant bundle on the punctual Hilbert scheme H of subschemes of length n of a smooth projective surface X. We show that for L and A invertible vector bundles on X, and w the canonical bundle of X, if $w^{-1}\otimes L$, $w^{-1}\otimes A$ and A are ample vector bundles, then the higher cohomology spaces on H of the tautological bundle associated to L tensor the determinant bundle associated to A vanish, and the space of global sections is computed in terms of $H^0(A)$ and $H^0(L\otimes A)$. This result is motivated by the computation of the space of global sections of the determinant bundle on the moduli space of rank 2 semi-stable sheaves on the projective plane, supporting Le Potier's Strange duality conjecture on the projective plane.
For smooth projective 3-folds of general type, we prove that the relative canonical stability $\mu_s(3)\leq 8$. This is induced from our improved result of Koll\'ar: the m-canonical map of a smooth projective 3-fold of general type is birational whenever $m\geq 5k+6$, provided $P_k(X)\geq 2$. The Q-divisor method is intensively developed to prove our results.
This note mainly studies the generic finiteness of \phi_m of a complex projective 3-fold of general type. A new result on the classification to bicanonical pencil for Gorenstein 3-folds is attached in the last section.
This file, provided as bibliographical information, contains the table of contents and editors' foreword from the proceedings of the July 1996 Warwick EuroConference on Algebraic Geometry.
Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus $g$, with $g\geq 2$, and ${\cal M}_{\xi}$ a smooth moduli space of fixed determinant semistable vector bundles of rank $n$, with $n\geq 2$, over $X$. Take a smooth anticanonical divisor $D$ on ${\cal M}_{\xi}$. So $D$ is a Calabi-Yau variety. We compute the number of moduli of $D$, namely $\dim H^1(D, T_D)$, to be $3g-4 + \dim H^0({\cal M}_{\xi}, K^{-1}_{{\cal M}_{\xi}})$. Denote by $\cal N$ the moduli space of all such pairs $(X',D')$, namely $D'$ is a smooth anticanonical divisor on a smooth moduli space of semistable vector bundles over the Riemann surface $X'$. It turns out that the Kodaira-Spencer map from the tangent space to $\cal N$, at the point represented by the pair $(X,D)$, to $H^1(D, T_D)$ is an isomorphism. This is proved under the assumption that if $g =2$, then $n\neq 2,3$, and if $g=3$, then $n\neq 2$.
We prove a vanishing theorem for the Hodge number h^21 of projective toric varieties provided by a certain class of polytopes. We explain how this Hodge number also gives information about the deformation theory of the toric Gorenstein singularity derived from the same polytope. In particular, the vanishing theorem for h^21 implies that these deformations are unobstructed.
Consider a primitive polynomial $f$ in two variables, thought of as a map from the affine plane to the affine line. We study the minimimal compactification of $f$; from our result one deduces in particular that if one of the fibers of $f$ has only one fiber at infinity, then all the fibers of $f$ have a simultaneous resolution of singularities at infinity. From this one gets a very simple proof of the Suzuki-Abhyankar-Moh theorem on the embeddings of the affine line in the plane.
For any positive integer $k$ and any integer $n$ large enough, we construct a Fano variety $X$ with Picard number $k$ and dimension $n$ such that $((-K_X)^n)^{1/n}$ grows like $n^k/(\log n)^{k-1}$.
Geometric Quantization links holomorphic geometry with real geometry, a relation that is a prototype for the modern development of mirror symmetry. We show how to use this treatment to construct a special basis in every space of conformal blocks. This is a direct generalization of the basis of theta functions with characteristics in every complete linear system on an Abelian variety (see Mumford's "Tata lectures on theta" cite(Mumford)). The same construction generalizes the classical theory of theta functions to vector bundles of higher rank on Abelian varieties and K3 surfaces. We also discuss the geometry behind these constructions.
A smooth compactification X<n> of the configuration space of n distinct labeled points in a smooth algebraic variety X is constructed by a natural sequence of blowups, with the full symmetry of the permutation group S_n manifest at each stage of the construction. The strata of the normal crossing divisor at infinity are labeled by trees with levels and their structure is studied. This is the maximal wonderful compactification in the sense of DeConcini-Procesi, and it has a strata-compatible surjection onto the Fulton-MacPherson compactification. The degenerate configurations added in the compactification are geometrically described by `polyscreens' similar to screens of Fulton and MacPherson. In characteristic 0, isotropy subgroups of the action of S_n on X<n> are abelian, thus X<n> may be a step toward an explicit resolution of singularities of the symmetric products X^n/S_n.
The Grassmannians of lines in projective N-space, G(1,N), are embedded by way of the Pl"ucker embedding in the projective space P(\bigwedge^2 C^{N+1}). Let H^l be a general l-codimensional linear subspace in this projective space.   We examine the geometry of the linear sections G(1,N)\cap H^l by studying their automorphism groups and list those which are homogeneous or quasihomogeneous.
In part I of this paper we constructed certain fibered Calabi-Yaus by a quotient construction in the context of weighted hypersurfaces. In this paper look at the case of K3 fibrations more closely and study the singular fibers which occur. This differs from previous work since the fibrations we discuss have constant modulus, and the singular fibers have torsion monodromy.
The aim of this article is to introduce standard bases of ideals in polynomial rings with respect to a class of orderings which are not necessarily semigroup orderings. Our approach generalises the concept of standard bases with respect to semigroup orderings described by Graebe and Greuel/Pfister. To compute these standard bases we give a slightly modified version of the Buchberger algorithm. The orderings we consider are refinements of certain filtrations. In the local case these filtrations are Newton filtrations. For a zero dimensional ideal, an algorithm converting standard bases with respect to local orderings is given. As an application, we show how to compute the spectrum of an isolated complex hypersurface singularity $f:(C^n,0)\to(C,0)$ with nondegenerate principal part.
We define special cycles on arithmetic models of twisted Hilbert-Blumenthal surfaces at primes of good reduction. These are arithmetic versions of these cycles. In particular, we characterize the non-degenerate intersections and partially determine the generating series formed from the intersection numbers of them relating it to the value at the center of symmetry of the derivative of a certain metaplectic Eisenstein series in 6 variables. These results are analogous to those obtained by us in the case of Siegel threefolds (alg-geom/9711025). We also study the case of degenerate intersections and show that in this case the intersection locus is a configuration of projective lines whose dual graph is described in terms of subcomplexes of the Bruhat-Tits building of PGL(2,F), where F is an unramified quadratic extension of Q_p.
We prove an analogue of the Lefschetz (1,1) Theorem characterizing cohomology classes of Cartier divisors (or equivalently first Chern classes of line bundles) in the second integral cohomology.   Let $X$ be a normal complex projective variety. We show that the classes of Cartier divisors in $H^2(X,Z)$ are precisely the classes $x$ such that (i) the image of $x$ in $H^2(X,C)$ (cohomology with complex coefficients) lies in $F^1 H^2(X,C)$ (first level of the Hodge filtration for Deligne's mixed Hodge structure), and (ii) $x$ is Zariski-locally trivial, i.e., there is a covering of $X$ by Zariski open sets $U$ such that $x$ has zero image in $H^2(U,Z)$.   For normal quasi-projective varieties, this positively answers a question of Barbieri-Viale and Srinivas (J. Reine Ang. Math. 450 (1994)), where examples are given to show that divisor classes are not characterized by either one of the above conditions (i), (ii), taken by itself, unlike in the case of non-singular varieties. The present paper also contains an example of a non-normal projective variety for which (i) and (ii) do not suffice to characterize divisor classes.
see the old abstract and the comments here.
We describe various properties of Hirzebruch surfaces and related constructions: degenerations, braid monodromy, Galois covers and their Chern classes.
We define a new class of holomorphic (n-1)-bundles on the n-dimensional complex projective space, that contains the Tango bundles and their stable Horrock's pull-backs; we show that these bundles are invariant under small deformations and that their isomorphism classes correspond to smooth points of moduli spaces.
We show that analytic torsion of smooth theta divisor is represented by a Siegel modular form characterizing the Andreotti-Mayer locus if its dimension is positive.
Let S be a smooth projective surfaces and S^[n] the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of S of length n. We proof that the class of S^[n] in the complex cobordism ring depends only on the class of the surface itself. Moreover, we compute the cohomology and holomorphic Euler characterisitcs of certain tautological sheaves on S^[n] and prove results on the general structure of certain integrals over polynomials in Chern classes of tautological sheaves.
Let $d,m_1,...,m_r$ be ($r+1$) positive integers, and $P_1,...,P_r$ be $r$ general points in the projective plane ; let $m$ be a positive integer. We prove that there exists a bound $d_0(m)$ such that :   If $m_i < m$ ($0<i<r+1$), and $d > d_0(m)$ then the linear system $L$ of plane curves of degree $d$ having a multiplicity at least $m_i$ at each point $P_i$ has the expected dimension ; moreover, if $L$ is not empty, there exists an irreducible plane curve of degree $d$, smooth away from the $r$ points $P_i$, and having an ordinary singularity of the prescribed multiplicity $m_i$ at each point $P_i$. This curve may be isolated in $L$.
Let $X$ be a smooth variety defined over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic and $\O_X(H)$ be a very ample line bundle on $X$. We show that for a semistable $X$-bundle $E$ of rank two, there exists an integer $m$ depending only on $\Delta(E).H^{\dim(X)-2}$ and $H^{\dim(X)}$ such that the restriction of $E$ to a general divisor in $|mH|$ is again semistable. As corollaries we obtain boundedness results, and weak versions of Bogomolov's theorem and Kodaira's vanishing theorem for surfaces in arbitrary characteristic.
The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula which allows one to compute the dimension of the cohomology groups of the sheaf $\Omega_{\P}^p(D)$ of p-th differential forms of Zariski twisted by an ample invertible sheaf on a complete simplicial toric variety. The formula involves some combinatorial sums of integer points over all faces of the support polytope for ${\O_X}(D)$. We also introduce a new combinatorial object, the so-called p-th Hilbert-Erhart polynomial, which generalizes the usual notion and behaves similar. Namely, there exists a generalization of the inversion law for a usual Hilbert-Erhart polynomial. Some applications of the Bott formula are discussed.
We consider the moduli spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a surface of genus g greater than 2 in the Lie groups SU(2,2) and Sp(4,R). It is well known that there is a characteristic number of such a representation, whose absolute value is less than or equal to 2g-2. This allows one to write the moduli space as a union of subspaces indexed by the characteristic number, each of which is a union of connected components. The main result of this paper is that the subspaces with characteristic number plus or minus 2g-2 are connected in the case of representations in SU(2,2), while they break up into 2^{2g+1}+2g-3 connected components in the case of representations in Sp(4,R). We obtain our results using the interpretation of the moduli space of representations as a moduli space of Higgs bundles, and an important step is an identification of certain subspaces as moduli spaces of stable triples, as studied by Bradlow and Garcia-Prada.
We deduce the Riemann-Roch type formula expressing the microlocal Euler class of a perfect complex of D-modules in terms of the Chern character of the associated symbol complex and the Todd class of the manifold from the Riemann-Roch type theorem for periodic cyclic cocycles of a symplectic deformation quantization. The proof of the latter is contained in the sequel to this paper.
For a non-isotrivial family of surfaces of general type over a complex projective curve, we give upper bounds for the degree of the direct images of powers of the relative dualizing sheaf. They imply that, fixing the curve and the possible degeneration locus, the induced morphisms to the moduli scheme of stable surfaces of general type are parameterized by a scheme of finite type. The method extends to families of canonically polarized manifolds, but the modular interpretation requires the existence of relative minimal models.
We give a short proof of W{\lodarczyk's theorem that any birational map between smooth projective varieties in characteristic zero is a composition of weighted blowups and blowdowns.
Let $X$ be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus $g$. We prove that the Brill-Noether locus $\bns $ is non-empty if $d= nd' +d'' $ with $0< d'' <2n$, $1\le s\le g$, $d'\geq (s-1)(s+g)/s $, $n\leq d''+(n-k)g$, $(d'',k)\ne(n,n)$. These results hold for an arbitrary curve of genus $\ge 2$, and allow us to construct a region in the associated ``Brill-Noether $\pa$-map'' of points for which the Brill-Noether loci are non-empty. Even for the generic case, the region so constructed extends beyond that defined by the so-called ``Teixidor parallelograms.'' For hyperelliptic curves, the same methods give more extensive and precise results.
There exists the Krichever map from the set of quintets (C,p,F,t,e) (where C is an integral and complete algebraic curve, p a smooth rational point, F a rank 2 torsion free coherent sheaf on C, t a local formal parameter in p and e a formal trivialization of F around p) to the infinite Grassmanian of $k((z)) \oplus k((z))$. We describe the images of quintets with (semi)stable sheaves F in terms of Plucker coordinates and get some analog of GIT Hilbert-Mumford numerical criterion with respect to actions of some 1-parametric subgroups of the group $SL(2,k[[z]])$ on the determinant bundle of the infinite Grassmanian.
Let H be the supremum of finitely many real polynomials of degree d and assume that H has a strict local minimum at 0. We prove a \L ojasiewicz-type inequality $H(x_1,...,x_n) > ||(x_1,...,x_n)||^s$ where s depends only on d and n. This implies a similar inequality where $(x_1,...,x_n)$ runs through the points of a semi-algebraic set.
Let Z be a zero-dimensional subscheme of the projective plane consisting of the union of r>5 double points, I its defining ideal sheaf. It is known that I has the expected cohomology when the points are distinct and in general position (Hirschowitz '85). We extend this result by allowing infinitely near points, one of them having bigger multiplicity. As an application, new bounds are given for the existence of plane curves with tacnodes and higher order cusps.
We generalize our theorems in "Mirror Principle I" to a class of balloon manifolds. Many of the results are proved for convex projective manifolds. In a subsequent paper, Mirror Principle III, we will extend the results to projective manifolds without the convexity assumption.
The aim of this note is to prove the analogue of Poincar\'e duality in the chiral Hodge cohomology.
Following Laumon [10], to a nonramified $\ell$-adic local system $E$ of rank $n$ on a curve $X$ one associates a complex of $\ell$-adic sheaves $_n{\cal K}_E$ on the moduli stack of rank $n$ vector bundles on $X$ with a section, which is cuspidal and satisfies Hecke property for $E$. This is a geometric counterpart of the well-known construction due to Shalika [17] and Piatetski-Shapiro [16]. We express the cohomology of the tensor product $_n{\cal K}_{E_1}\otimes {_n{\cal K}_{E_2}}$ in terms of cohomology of the symmetric powers of $X$. This may be considered as a geometric interpretation of the local part of the classical Rankin-Selberg method for GL(n) in the framework of the geometric Langlands program.
An approach for the computation of upper bounds on the size of large complete arcs is presented. We obtain in particular geometrical properties of irreducible envelopes associated to a second largest complete arc provided that the order of the underlying field is large enough. We use Stoehr-Voloch's approach to the Hasse-Weil bound for rational points of curves defined over finite fields
We identify the holomorphic de Rham complex of the minimal extension of a meromorphic vector bundle with connexion on a compact Riemann surface X with the L^2 complex relative to a suitable metric on the bundle and a complete metric on the punctured Riemann surface. Applying results of C. Simpson, we show the existence of a harmonic metric on this vector bundle, giving the same L^2 complex. As a consequence, we obtain a Hard Lefschetz-type theorem.
A natural question is to determine which algebraic stacks are qoutient stacks. In this paper we give some partial answers and relate it to the old question of whether, for a scheme X, the natural map from the Brauer goup (equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras) to the cohomological Brauer group (the torsion subgroup of $H^2(X,{\mathbb G}_m)$ is surjective.
The aim of this note is to give simple proofs of some results of Reichstein and Youssin (math.AG/9903162) about the behaviour of fixed points of finite group actions under rational maps. Our proofs work in any characteristic. We also give a short proof of the Nishimura lemma.
This is a revised version of my paper which appeared in J. Math. Sci. Univ. Tokyo. We prove that for a flipping contraction from a Gorenstein terminal 4-fold, the pull back of a general hyperplane section of the down-stair has only canonical singularities. Based on this fact and using Siu-Kawamata-Nakayama's extension theorem [Si], [Kaw4], [Kaw5] and [Nak2], we prove the existence of the flip of such a flipping contraction. Furthermore we classify such flipping contractions and the flips under some additional assumptions.
We obtain a classification of a Q-factorial Q-Fano 3-fold $X$ with the following properties:   the Picard number of $X$ is 1;   the Gorenstein index of $X$ is 2;   the Fano index of $X$ is 1/2;   $h^0 (-K_X) \geq 4$;   there exists an index 2 point $P$ such that $(X,P)\simeq (\{xy +f(z^2,u)=0\} / \Bbb Z_2 (1,1,1,0), o)$ with $ord f(Z,U)=1$.
A linear system of plane curves satisfying multiplicity conditions at points in general position is called special if the dimension is larger than the expected dimension. A (-1) curve is an irreducible curve with self intersection -1 and genus zero. The Harbourne-Hirschowitz Conjecture is that a linear system is special only if a multiple of some fixed (-1) curve is contained in every curve of the linear system. This conjecture is proven for linear systems with multiplicity four at all but one of the points.
We prove that a smooth surface, non of general type, in projective four-space, which lies on a quartic hypersurface with isolated singularities has degree at most 27 (in fact we prove a slightly more general result).
The Pluecker relations are equations which describe decomposable multivectors in $\bigwedge V$. We review all known versions, give some new ones, and decompose them into irreducible parts for the $GL(V)$-representations.
I prove the existence, and describe the structure, of moduli space of pairs $(p,\Theta)$ consisting of a projective variety $P$ with semiabelian group action and an ample Cartier divisor on it satisfying a few simple conditions. Every connected component of this moduli space is proper. A component containing a projective toric variety is described by a configuration of several polytopes, the main one of which is the secondary polytope. On the other hand, the component containing a principally polarized abelian variety provides a moduli compactification of $A_g$. The main irreducible component of this compactification is described by an "infinite periodic" analog of the secondary polytope and coincides with the toroidal compactification of $A_g$ for the second Voronoi decomposition.
We construct a natural branch divisor for equidimensional projective morphisms where the domain has lci singularities and the target is nonsingular. The method involves generalizing a divisor contruction of Mumford from sheaves to complexes. The construction is valid in flat families. The generalized branch divisor of a stable map to a nonsingular curve X yields a canonical morphism from the space of stable maps to a symmetric product of X. This branch morphism (together with virtual localization) is used to compute the Hurwitz numbers of covers of P^1 for all genera and degrees in terms of Hodge integrals.
In this article, we prove that any Q-Calabi-Yau 3-fold with only ordinary terminal singularities and any Q-Fano 3-fold of Fano index 1 with only terminal singularities have Q-smoothings.
In this article, we prove that any $\Bbb Q$-factorial weak Fano 3-fold with only terminal singularities has a smoothing.
Let $X$ be a complex projective manifold. Fix two ample line bundles $H_0$ and $H_1$ on $X$. It is the aim of this note to study the variation of the moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable sheaves for polarizations lying in the cone spanned by $H_0$ and $H_1$. We attempt a new definition of walls which naturally describes the behaviour of Gieseker semistability. By means of an example, we establish the possibility of non-rational walls which is a substantially new phenomenon compared to the surface case. Using the approach of Ellingsrud and Goettsche via parabolic sheaves, we were able to show that the moduli spaces undergo a sequence of GIT flips while passing a rational wall.
In a previous paper the authors elaborated notions and technique which could be applied to compute such invariants of polynomials as Euler characteristics of fibres and zeta-functions of monodromy transformations associated with a polynomial. Some crucial basic properties of the notions related to the topology of meromorphic germs were not discussed there. This has produced some lack of understanding of the general constructions. The aim of this note is to partially fill in this gap. At the same time we describe connections with some previous results and generalizations of them.
In this manuscript we prove that if two cuspidal plane curves have equivalent braid monodromy factorizations, then they are smoothly isotopic in the plane. As a consequence of this and the Chisini conjecture, we obtain that if two discriminant curves (or branch curves in other terminology) of generic projections (to the plane) of surfaces of general type imbedded in a projective space by means of a multiple canonical class have equivalent braid monodromy factorizations, then the surfaces are diffeomorphic (if we consider them as real 4-folds).
A short note that contains some Cliff's notes of the general theory (see math.AG/9905103) but concentrates on one of the stranger aspects of it - existence of other irreducible components.
It is proved that a smooth rational surface in projective four-space, which is ruled by cubics or quartics has degree at most 12. It is also proved that a smooth rational surface in projective four-space which is the image of Fn by a linear system with "simple base points" (see text) has degree at most 12.
A new proof of the mirror conjecture for Fano and Calabi-Yau complete intersections in P^n is given, using only the circle action on the graph space. The proof applies to projective bundles as well, with applications to "linear" relative Calabi-Yau's and to Schubert calculus.
We simplify the usual statement of the Torelli theorem for complex Enriques surfaces, by means of a lattice-theoretic trick. This allows easy proofs of several known results, which previously required intricate arithmetic arguments. The main new result is that the moduli space has contractible universal cover.
Realizing a part of the Derived Deformation Theory program, we construct a "derived" analog of the Grothendieck's Quot scheme parametrizing subsheaves in a given coherent sheaf F on a smooth projective variety X. This analog is a differential graded manifold RQuot_h(F) (so it is always smooth in an appropriate sense) whose tangent space at a point represented by a subsheaf K in F, is a cochain complex quasiisomorphic to RHom(K, F/K).
Let X be a K3 surface with an involution g which has non-empty fixed locus X^g and acts non-trivially on a non-zero holomorphic 2-form. We shall construct all such pairs (X, g) in a canonical way, from some better known double coverings of log del Pezzo surfaces of index at most 2 or rational elliptic surfaces, and construct the only family of each of the three extremal cases where X^g contains 10 (maximum possible) curves. We also classify rational log Enriques surfaces of index 2. Our approach is more geometrical rather than lattice-theoretical (see Nikulin's paper for the latter approach).
We show that there are exactly, up to isomorphisms, seven extremal log Enriques surfaces Z and construct all of them; among them types D_{19} and A_{19} have been shown of certain uniqueness by M. Reid. We also prove that the (degree 3 or 2) canonical covering of each of these seven Z has either X_3 or X_4 as its minimal resolution. Here X_3 (resp. X_4) is the unique K3 surface with Picard number 20 and discriminant 3 (resp. 4), which are called the most algebraic K3 surfaces by Vinberg and have infinite automorphism groups (by Shioda-Inose and Vinberg).
Let X be a K3 surface with the Neron-Severi lattice S_X and transcendental lattice T_X. Nukulin considered the kernel H_X of the natural representation Aut(X) ---> O(S_X) and proved that H_{X} is a finite cyclic group with phi(h(X))) | t(X) and acts faithfully on the space H^{2,0}(X) = C omega_{X}, where h(X) = ord(H_X), t(X) = rank T_X and phi(.) is the Euler function. Consider the extremal case where phi(h(X)) = t(X). In the situation where T_{X} is unimodular, Kondo has determined the list of t(X), as well as the actual realizations, and showed that t(X) alone uniquely determines the isomorphism class of X (with phi(h(X)) = t(X)). We settle the remaining situation where T_X is not unimodular. Together, we provide the proof for the theorem announced by Vorontsov.
With the help of Mori theory for projective toric manifolds due to M. Reid, we study non projective toric manifolds which become projective after a single blow up along an invariant curve.
Interpreting the number of ramified covering of a Riemann surface by Riemann surfaces as the relative Gromov-Witten invariants and applying a gluing formula, we derive a recursive formula for the number of ramified covering of a Riemann surface by Riemann surface with elementary branch points and prescribed ramification type over a special point.
Using local cohomology and algebraic D-Modules, we generalize a comparison theorem between relative de Rham cohomology and Dwork cohomology due to N. Katz, A. Adolphson and S. Sperber.
We introduce the notion of mixed Hodge complex on an algebraic variety, improving Du Bois' filtered complex, and relate Deligne's theory of mixed Hodge structure with the theory of mixed Hodge module. This was supposed to be true, but is quite nontrivial, because the theory of mixed Hodge module does not work on a simplicial scheme. Some application to the Du Bois singularity is given.
An explanation to the boundness of minimal log discrepancies conjectured by V.V. Shokurov would be that the minimal log discrepancies of a variety in its closed points define a lower semi-continuous function. We check this lower semi-continuity behaviour for varieties of dimension at most 3 and for toric varieties of arbitrary dimension.
The aim of this article is to obtain restrictions on complex orientations of dividing real J-curves of almost-complex manifolds. This problem comes from real algebraic geometry and the main result is a congruence generalising Arnol'd, Rokhlin, Mishachev, Zvonilov and Mikhalkin 's previous results. This congruence is obtained with a canonical map defined on homology groups of dimension half the dimension of the manifold with coefficients in $Z/lZ$, with values in $Z/2lZ$.
We construct 0-cycles on the product of 2 elliptic curves, which are not detectable by Bloch's analytic motivic cohomology.
In this note we compute the cohomological obstruction to the existence of certain sheaves of vertex algebras on smooth varieties. These sheaves have been introduced and studied in the previous work by A.Vaintrob and two of the authors. Hopefully our result clarifies to some extent the constructions of the above work.
We formulate a generalization of Givental-Kim's quantum hyperplane principle. This is applied to compute the quantum cohomology of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold defined as the rank 4 locus of a general skew-symmetric 7x7 matrix with coeffisients in P^6. The computation verifies the mirror symmetry predictions of R\o dland in math.AG/9801092.
We study the algebraic Gauss-Manin system and the algebraic Brieskorn module associated to a polynomial mapping with isolated singularities. Since the algebraic Gauss-Manin system does not contain any information on the cohomology of singular fibers, we first construct a non quasi-coherent sheaf which gives the cohomology of every fiber. Then we study the algebraic Brieskorn module, and show that its position in the the algebraic Gauss-Manin system is determined by a natural map to quotients of local analytic Gauss-Manin systems, and its pole part by the vanishing cycles at infinity, comparing it with the Deligne extension. This implies for example a formula for the determinant of periods. In the two-dimensional case we can describe the global structure of the algebraic Gauss-Manin system rather explicitly.
The `linear orbit' of a plane curve of degree d is its orbit in P^{d(d+3)/2} under the natural action of PGL(3). We classify curves with positive dimensional stabilizer, and we compute the degree of the closure of the linear orbits of curves supported on unions of lines. Together with the results of math.AG/9805020, this encompasses the enumerative geometry of all plane curves with small linear orbit. This information will serve elsewhere as an ingredient in the computation of the degree of the orbit closure of an arbitrary plane curve.
We prove that every log crepant birational morphism between log terminal surfaces is decomposed into log-flopping type divisorial contraction morphisms and log blow-downs. Repeating these two kinds of contractions we reach a minimal log minimal surface from any log minimal surface.
Let $k(d)$ be the maximal possible integer $k$ such that there exists a plane curve of degree $d$ with an $A_k$--singularity. We construct a plane curve of degree $28s+9$ ($s\in\Z_{\ge 0}$) which has an $A_k$--singularity with $k=420s^2+269s+42$. Therefore one has $\underline{\lim}_{d\to\infty}k(d)/d^2\ge 15/28$ (pay attention that $15/28>1/2$).
Let g be an integer greater than 1. A uniform version of the Parshin-Arakelov theorem on the finiteness of the set of non-isotrivial curves of genus g over a function field, with fixed degeneracy locus, is proved. This is applied to obtain a uniform version of Manin theorem (the Mordell conjecture on rational points for curves of genus g over function fields). By a "function field" is meant the function field of a complex variety V of any dimension. If V is a curve, the uniform bounds will depend on g, on the genus of V and on the cardinality of the degeneracy locus.
We describe algebraically defined cohomological and homological Albanese and Picard 1-motives (or mixed motives) of any algebraic variety in characteristic zero, generalizing the classical Albanese and Picard varieties. We compute Hodge, l-adic and De Rham realizations proving Deligne's conjecture for the concerned mixed Hodge structures.   We investigate functoriality, universality, homotopical invariance and invariance under formation of projective bundles. We compare our cohomological and homological 1-motives for normal schemes. For proper schemes, we obtain an Abel-Jacobi map from the (Levine-Weibel) Chow group of zero cycles to our cohomological Albanese 1-motive which is the universal regular homomorphism to semi-abelian varieties. By using this universal property we get 'motivic' Gysin maps for projective local complete intersection morphisms.   This paper is an extended version of our preliminary Comptes Rendus Note, Academie des Sciences, Paris, Vol. 326, 1998.
In this paper we consider the analogue of the Sato's functional equation for the prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields. The corresponding character sums depend on a relative invariant on such a space and an irreducible representation of the group of components of the stabilizer of a generic point. The proof is based on the Picard-Lefschetz formula in $l$-adique cohomology.
We suggest an effective procedure to calculate numerical invariants for rank two bundles over blown-up surfaces. We study the moduli spaces M_j of bundles on the blown-up plane splitting over the exceptional divisor as O(j)+O(-j). We use the numerical invariants to give a topological decomposition of M_j.
A report at Arbeitstagung, June 1999, Bonn, on the joint work with V.Gorbounov, F.Malikov and A.Vaintrob.
Many applications modeled by polynomial systems have positive dimensional solution components (e.g., the path synthesis problems for four-bar mechanisms) that are challenging to compute numerically by homotopy continuation methods. A procedure of A. Sommese and C. Wampler consists in slicing the components with linear subspaces in general position to obtain generic points of the components as the isolated solutions of an auxiliary system. Since this requires the solution of a number of larger overdetermined systems, the procedure is computationally expensive and also wasteful because many solution paths diverge. In this article an embedding of the original polynomial system is presented, which leads to a sequence of homotopies, with solution paths leading to generic points of all components as the isolated solutions of an auxiliary system. The new procedure significantly reduces the number of paths to solutions that need to be followed. This approach has been implemented and applied to various polynomial systems, such as the cyclic n-roots problem.
This is an announcement of a long paper in progress. On a locally compact space, we introduce the stack of ind-sheaves (ind-objects of the category of sheaves with compact support) and construct the analogous of the usual six operations on sheaves. As an application, we treat, in the formalism of ind-sheaves, functions with growth conditions such as the ``tempered holomorphic functions'' on a complex manifold. We also construct a microlocalization functor from the category of sheaves on a manifold to that of ind-sheaves on the cotangent bundle.
We study locally Cohen-Macaulay curves in projective three-space which are contained in a double plane 2H, thus completing the classification of curves lying on surfaces of degree two. We describe the irreducible components of the Hilbert schemes of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves in 2H of given degree and arithmetic genus. We show that these Hilbert schemes are connected. We also discuss the Rao modules of these curves, and liaison and biliaison equivalence classes.
Let x(t) be a trajectory of the gradient of a real analytic function and suppose that x_0 is a limit point of x(t). We prove the gradient conjecture of R. Thom which states that the secants of x(t) at x_0 have a limit. Actually we show a stronger statement: the radial projection of x(t) from x_0 onto the unit sphere has finite length.
In this paper, we show the moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces are irreducible symplectic manifolds, if the associated Mukai vectors are primitive. More precisely, we show that they are related to the Hilbert scheme of points. We also compute the period of these spaces. As an application of our result, we discuss Montonen-Olive duality in Physics. In particular our computations of Euler characteristics of moduli spaces are compatible with Physical computations by Minahan et al.
We construct a general semiregularity map for cycles on a complex analytic or algebraic manifold and show that such semiregularity map can be obtained from the classical tool of the Atiyah-Chern character. The first part of the paper is fairly detailed, deducing the existence and explicit form of a generalized semiregularity map from known results and constructions. We obtain as well a description of the infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map for smooth cycles as the leading term of this generalized semiregularity map, indicate why for locally complete intersections the appropriate component of our semiregularity map coincides with the one constructed by Bloch, and give applications to embedded deformations and deformations of coherent modules.
We prove that the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space M_{23} of curves of genus 23 is at least 2. We also present some evidence for the hypothesis that the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space is actually equal to 2. Note that for g > 23 the moduli space is of general type, while for g\leq 22, Harris and Morrison conjectured that M_g is uniruled. The result on M_{23} is obtained by investigating the relative position of three explicit multicanonical divisors which are of Brill-Noether type.
In the present paper we describe the K3 surfaces admitting order 11 automorphisms and apply this to classify log Enriques surfaces of global index 11.
We give a "modern" version, based on Mori theory, of the classification of birational involutions of P^2 up to conjugacy. The result has been known for more than one century but the classical proofs are not always convincing.
This is a comment on the Kuranishi method of constructing analytic deformation spaces. It is based on a simple observation that the Kuranishi map can always be inverted in the category of $L_{\infty}$-algebras. The $L_{\infty}$-structure obtained by this inversion is used to define an ''unobstructed'' deformation functor which is always representable by a smooth pointed moduli space.   The singular nature of the original Kuranishi deformation space emerges in this setting merely as a result of the truncation of this ``naive'' $L_{\infty}$-algebra controlling the deformations to a usual differential Lie algebra.
We construct complete Kahler metrics of Saper type on the nonsingular set of a subvariety X of a compact Kahler manifold using (a) a method for replacing a sequence of blow-ups along smooth centers, used to resolve the singularities of X, with a single blow-up along a product of coherent ideals corresponding to the centers and (b) an explicit local formula for a Chern form associated to this single blow-up. Our metrics have a particularly simple local formula, involving essentially a product of distances to the centers of the blow-ups used to resolve the singularities of X. Our proof of (a) uses a generalization of Chow's theorem for coherent ideals, proved using the Direct Image Theorem.
The moduli space M(r,d) of stable, rank r, degree d vector bundles on a smooth projective curve of genus g>1 is shown to be birational to M(h,0) x A, where h=hcf(r,d) and A is affine space of dimension (r^2-h^2)(g-1). The birational isomorphism is compatible with fixing determinants in M(r,d) and M(h,0) and we obtain as a corollary that the moduli space of bundles of rank r and fixed determinant of degree d is rational, when r and d are coprime. A key ingredient in the proof is the use of a naturally defined Brauer class for the function field of M(r,d).
Given a covering f: X \to Y of projective manifolds, we consider the vector bundle E on Y given as the dual of f_*(\O_X) / \O_Y. This vector bundles often has positivity properties, e.g. E is ample when Y is projective space by a theorem of Lazarsfeld. In general however E will not be ample due to the geometry of Y. We prove various results when E is spanned, nef or generically nef, under some assumptions on the base Y.
We consider the quotients $X = V/G$ of a symplectic complex vector space $V$ by a finite subgroup $G \subset Sp(V)$ which admit a smooth crepant resolution $Y \to X$. For such quotients, we prove the homological McKay correspondence conjectured by M. Reid. Namely, we construct a natural basis in the homology space $H_\cdot(Y,\Q)$ whose elements are numbered by the conjugacy classes in the finite group $G$.
Periodenbereiche sind gewisse offene Unterraeume von verallgemeinerten Flaggenvarietaeten, welche durch Semistabilitaetsbedingungen beschrieben werden. In dem Fall eines endlichen Grundkoerpers bilden diese eine Zariski-offene Untervarietaet, im Fall eines lokalen Koerpers einen zulaessigen offenen Unterraum im Sinne der rigiden algebraischen Geometrie. In dieser Arbeit berechnen wir fuer den Fall eines endlichen Grundkoerpers die l-adische Kohomologie mit kompaktem Traeger dieser Periodenbereiche. Das Ergebnis bestaetigt eine Vermutung von Kottwitz und Rapoport.
The goal of this paper is to give an explicit formula for the l-adic cohomology of period domains over finite fields for arbitrary reductive groups. The result is a generalisation of the computation in math.AG/9907098 which treats the case of the general linear group.
Let SU_C(2) denote the moduli variety of rank 2 semistable vector bundles with trivial determinant on an algebraic curve C. We prove that if C is trigonal then there exists a projective moduli variety N_C containing SU_C(2) as a subvariety and smooth of dimension 7g-14 away from SU_C(2). N_C parametrises Galois Spin(8)-bundles on the Galois closure of C over P^1. Moreover, if x in J_C[2] is a 2-torsion point let R(x) be the Recillas tetragonal curve whose Jacobian is isomorphic to Prym(C,x). Then there is an injection of SU_R(x)(2) into N_C giving a `nonabelian Schottky configuration' in N_C singular along the classical Schottky configuration in SU_C(2).
This is a revised version of a part of the author's preprint "On p-adic uniformization of fake projective planes" (preprint, Max-Planck-Institut fuer Mathematik, 1998 (121)).   In this paper we construct explicitly a Shimura surface of PEL-type, associated to a certain unitary group, whose connected components are isomorphic to Mumford's fake projective plane. We also give the canonical model, Shimura field and number of connected components of this Shimura surface. As a consequence of the construction we prove that the Mumford's fake projective plane is an arithmetic complex unit-ball quotient, and has the 7-th cyclotomic field as a field of definition.   In Tohoku Math. J. 50 (1998), 537-555, Masanori Ishida and the author discussed two other possible fake projective planes. The author has also obtained the corresponding results as above for these fake projective planes and has written them in the above preprint, which is available in the web page: http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/html/preprints/preprints.html
In this paper we discuss log blow-up's, introduced by Kazuya Kato, and define the concept of log modifications. Using this concept we prove that any morphism f: X ---> Y of locally noetherian fs log schemes with underlying structures of f and Y quasi-compact can be modified to an exact morphism, and moreover to an integral morphism. By a well-known fact on the underlying structure of an integral morphism this result can be considered as a weak log-version of flattening theorem by Raynaud and Gruson.
We give an elementary proof of the following projectivity criterion of Huybrechts: a compact K\"ahler surface is projective if and only if the dual K\"ahler cone contains an inner integral point.
Let G be a split connected reductive group over a finite field F_q, and N its maximal unipotent subgroup. V. Drinfeld has introduced a remarkable partial compactification of the moduli stack of N-bundles on a smooth projective curve X over F_q. In this paper we study Drinfeld's moduli space and a certain category of perverse sheaves on it. The definition of this category is motivated by the study of the Whittaker functions on the group G(K), where K=F_q((t)). We prove that our category is semi-simple, and that irreducible objects of this category are "clean", i.e., they are extenstions by 0 of local systems supported on the strata. As an application of these results, we obtain a purely geometric proof of the Casselman-Shalika formula for the Whittaker functions.
We give a complete quiver description of the category of perverse sheaves on Hermitian symmetric spaces in types A and D, constructible with respect to the Schubert stratification. The calculation is microlocal, and uses the action of the Borel group to study the geometry of the conormal variety.
The Jacobian Conjecture would follow if it were known that real polynomial maps with a unipotent Jacobian matrix are injective. The conjecture that this is true even for $C^1$ maps is explored here. Some results known in the polynomial case are extended to the $C^1$ context, and some special cases are resolved.
We present a result which can be used for stratifications with conical singularities to deduce that a perverse sheaf (in particular, an intersection homology sheaf) has reducible characteristic variety, given a hypothesis on the monodromy of the vanishing cycles local system of a stratum. We apply it to explain most of the examples currently known where SS(IC(X)) is reducible for X a Schubert variety in a flag variety.
We prove a factorization theorem of generalized functions for moduli spaces of semistable parabolic bundles of any rank.
We give a formalism of arithmetic mixed sheaves including the case of arithmetic mixed Hodge structures, and show the nonvanishing of certain higher extension groups, and also the nontriviality of the second Abel-Jacobi map for zero cycles on a smooth proper complex variety of any dimension under the existence of a nontrivial global two-form. For two codimensional cycles, the injectivity of the cycle map is reduced to that of the Abel-Jacobi map for smooth projective varieties over number fields. (This shows that Asakura's additional hypothesis is unnecessary). Here it is also possible to use the systems of realizations in the definition of the cycle map and the Abel-Jacobi map. Some arguments can be extended to higher Chow groups, and we get evidence for a conjecture of C. Voisin on the countability of indecomposable higher cycles.
In this paper, we prove that the notions of Hilbert stability and Mumford stability agree for vector bundles of arbitrary rank over smooth curves. The notion of Hilbert stability was introduced by Gieseker and Morrison in 1984, and they showed that for smooth curves and vector bundles of rank two it agrees with Mumford stability. A different proof for the rank two case was given by M. Teixidor i Bigas. Our proof uses a new approach and avoids complicated computations. Our results might serve as a first step in the construction of the Hilbert stable compactification of the universal moduli space of stable vector bundles over the moduli space of smooth curves as suggested by Teixidor.
In this paper, we show some applications to algebraic cycles by using higher Abel-Jacobi maps which were defined in [the author: Motives and algebraic de Rham cohomology]. In particular, we prove that the Beilinson conjecture on algebraic cycles over number fields implies the Bloch conjecture on zero-cycles on surfaces. Moreover, we construct a zero-cycle on a product of curves whose Mumford invariant vanishes, but not higher Abel-Jacobi invariant.
Given a non-singular variety with a K3 fibration f : X --> S we construct dual fibrations Y --> S by replacing each fibre X_s of f by a two-dimensional moduli space of stable sheaves on X_s. In certain cases we prove that the resulting scheme Y is a non-singular variety and construct an equivalence of derived categories of coherent sheaves \Phi : D(Y) --> D(X). Our methods also apply to elliptic and abelian surface fibrations. As an application we show how the equivalences \Phi identify certain moduli spaces of stable bundles on elliptic threefolds with Hilbert schemes of curves.
Let G be a finite group of automorphisms of a nonsingular complex threefold M such that the canonical bundle omega_M is locally trivial as a G-sheaf. We prove that the Hilbert scheme Y=GHilb M parametrising G-clusters in M is a crepant resolution of X=M/G and that there is a derived equivalence (Fourier- Mukai transform) between coherent sheaves on Y and coherent G-sheaves on M. This identifies the K theory of Y with the equivariant K theory of M, and thus generalises the classical McKay correspondence. Some higher dimensional extensions are possible.
This is primarily an expository piece and the first sentence of the introduction pretty much sums it up: This article is aimed at people who already know what mixed Hodge structures are and what they are good for, but who are not sure how to construct them.
Let SU_X(n,L) be the moduli space of rank n semistable vector bundles with fixed determinant L on a smooth projective genus g>1 curve X. Let SU_X^s(n,L) denote the open subset parameterizing stable bundles. We show that for small i, the mixed Hodge structure on H^i(SU_X^s(n, L), Q) is independent of the degree of L, and hence pure of weight i. Moreover any simple factors is, up to Tate twisting, isomorphic to a summand of a tensor power of H^1(X,Q). A more precise statement for i = 3, yields a Torelli theorem complementing earlier work of several authors. This is a replacement of our preprint Intermediate Jacobians of Moduli spaces which contained a gap.
We prove a closed formula for integrals of the cotangent line classes against the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of stable pointed curves. These integrals are computed via relations obtained from virtual localization in Gromov-Witten theory. An analysis of several natural matrices indexed by partitions is required.
For any smooth complex projective variety X and smooth very ample hypersurface Y in X, we develop the technique of genus zero relative Gromov-Witten invariants of Y in X in algebro-geometric terms. We prove an equality of cycles in the Chow groups of the moduli spaces of relative stable maps that relates these relative invariants to the Gromov-Witten invariants of X and Y. Given the Gromov-Witten invariants of X, we show that these relations are sufficient to compute all relative invariants, as well as all genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of Y whose homology and cohomology classes are induced by X.
We prove the finite generation of canonical rings of projective variety of general type defined over complex numbers.
This article treats the Picard group of the moduli (stack) of r-spin curves and its compactification. Generalized spin curves, or r-spin curves are a natural generalization of 2-spin curves (algebraic curves with a theta-characteristic), and have been of interest lately because they are the subject of a remarkable conjecture of E. Witten, and because of the similarities between the intersection theory of these moduli spaces and that of the moduli of stable maps.   We generalize results of Cornalba, giving relations between many of the elements of the Picard group of the stacks. These relations are important in the proof of the genus-zero case of Witten's conjecture given in math.AG/9905034. We use these relations to show that when 2 or 3 divides r, then the Picard group of the open stack has non-zero torsion. And finally, we work out some specific examples for small values of g and r.
In this paper, we define a certain Hodge-theoretic structure for an arbitrary variety X over the complex number field by using the theory of mixed Hodge module due to Morihiko Saito. We call it an arithmetic Hodge structure of X. It is shown that extension groups of arithmetic Hodge structure do not vanish even for degree $\geq2$. Moreover, we define higher Abel-Jacobi maps from Bloch's higher Chow groups of X to these extension groups. These maps essentially involve the classical Abel-Jacobi maps by Weil and Griffiths, and Mumford's infinitesimal invariants of 0-cycles on surfaces.
We prove a derived category version of the Sebastiani-Thom Theorem, which describes the vanishing cycles of the sum of two functions of disjoint variables.
We compare and contrast various notions of the "critical locus" of a complex analytic function on a singular space. After choosing a topological variant as our primary notion of the critical locus, we justify our choice by generalizing L\^e and Saito's result that constant Milnor number implies that Thom's a_f condition is satisfied.
Throughout our work on the L\^e cycles of an affine hypersurface singularity, our primary algebraic tool consisted of a method for taking the Jacobian ideal of a complex analytic function and decomposing it into pure-dimensional "pieces". These pieces were obtained by considering the relative polar varieties of L\^e and Teissier as gap sheaves. A gap sheaf is a formal device which gives a scheme-theoretic meaning to the analytic closure of the difference of an initial scheme and an analytic set. We would like to extend our results on L\^e cycles to functions on an arbitrary complex analytic space, and so we generalize this algebraic approach.   We begin with an ordered set of generators for an ideal, and produce a collection of pure-dimensional analytic cycles, the Vogel cycles, which seem to contain a great deal of ``geometric'' data related to the original ideal. We prove a number of useful results, including some extremely general L\^e-Iomdine-Vogel formulas; these formulas generalize the L\^e Iomdine formulas that we used so profitably in previous work.
A working mathematician's summary of many results on the derived category, perverse sheaves, and vanishing cycles. This is the September 2013 version.
We define two equivalent notions of twisted stable map from a curve to a Deligne-Mumford stack with projective moduli space, and we prove that twisted stable maps of fixed degree form a complete Deligne-Mumford stack with projective moduli space.
Let Y be a normal crossing divisor in the smooth projective algebraic variety X (defined over ${\mathbb C}$) and let U be a tubular neighbourhood of Y in X. We construct homological cycles generating $H_*(A,B)$, where (A,B) is one of the following pairs $(Y,\emptyset)$, (X,Y), (X,X-Y), $(X-Y,\emptyset)$ and $(\partial U,\emptyset)$. The construction is compatible with the weights in $H_*(A,B,{\mathbb Q})$ of Deligne's mixed Hodge structure.
We prove that there exists a positive integer $\nu_{n}$ depending only on $n$ such that for every smooth projective $n$-fold of general type $X$ defined over {\bf C}, $\mid mK_{X}\mid$ gives a birational rational map from $X$ into a projective space for every $m\geq \nu_{n}$. This theorem gives an affirmative answer to Severi's conjecture. The key ingredients of the proof are the theory of AZD which was originated by the aurhor and the subadjunction formula for AZD's of logcanoncial divisors.
Let $(P\in X,\Delta)$ be a three dimensional log canonical pair such that $\Delta$ has only standard coefficients and $P$ is a center of log canonical singularities for $(X,\Delta)$. Then we get an effective bound of the indices of these pairs and actually determine all the possible indices. Furthermore, under certain assumptions including the log Minimal Model Program, an effective bound is also obtained in dimension $n\geq 4$.
We give a method for constructing Kummer covers with many points over finite fields.
We study lower bounds for the self-intersection of the canonical divisor of "canonical varieties" (i.e. varieties whose canonical linear system gives a birational map). We give some improvements for the known results in the case of surfaces and new bounds for the case of canonical threefolds.
We study from a geographical point of view fibrations of threefolds over smooth curves, such that the general fibre is of general type. We prove the non-negativity of certain relative invariants under general hypotheses and give lower bounds for the self-interssection of the relative canonical divisor of the fibration, depending on other relative invariants. We also study the influence of the relative irregularity on these bounds. A more detailed study of the lowest cases of the bounds is given.
This paper combines algebraic and Lagrangian geometry to construct a special basis in every space of conformal blocks, the Bohr-Sommerfeld (BS) basis. We use the method of [D. Borthwick, T. Paul and A. Uribe, Legendrian distributions with applications to the non-vanishing of Poincar\'e series of large weight, Invent. math, 122 (1995), 359-402, preprint hep-th/9406036], whereby every vector of a BS basis is defined by some half-weighted Legendrian distribution coming from a Bohr-Sommerfeld fibre of a real polarization of the underlying symplectic manifold. The advantage of BS bases (compared to bases of theta functions in [A. Tyurin, Quantization and ``theta functions'', Jussieu preprint 216 (Apr 1999), e-print math.AG/9904046, 32pp.]) is that we can use information from the skillful analysis of the asymptotics of quantum states. This gives that Bohr-Sommerfeld bases are unitary quasi-classically. Thus we can apply these bases to compare the Hitchin connection with the KZ connection defined by the monodromy of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation in combinatorial theory (see, for example, [T. Kohno, Topological invariants for 3-manifolds using representations of mapping class group I, Topology 31 (1992), 203-230; II, Contemp. math 175} (1994), 193-217]).
Iku Nakamura [Hilbert schemes of Abelian group orbits, J. Alg. Geom. 10 (2001), 757--779] introduced the G-Hilbert scheme for a finite subgroup G in SL(3,C), and conjectured that it is a crepant resolution of the quotient C^3/G. He proved this for a diagonal Abelian group A by introducing an explicit algorithm that calculates A-Hilb C^3. This note calculates A-Hilb C^3 much more simply, in terms of fun with continued fractions plus regular tesselations by equilateral triangles.
For an irreducible subvariety Z in an algebraic group G we define a nonnegative integer gdeg(Z) as the degree, in a certain sense, of the Gauss map of Z. It can be regarded as a substitution for the intersection index of the conormal bundle to Z with the zero section of T^*G, even though G may be non-compact. For G a semiabelian variety (in particular, an algebraic torus (C^*)^n) we prove a Riemann-Roch-type formula for constructible sheaves on G, which involves our substitutions for the intersection indices. As a corollary, we get that a perverse sheaf on such a G has nonnegative Euler characteristic, generalizing a theorem of Loeser-Sabbah.
Modifying an approach of J. Roe, this paper gives an improved lower bound on the degrees d such that for general points p1,...,pn in P2 and m > 0 there is a plane curve of degree d vanishing at each point pi with multiplicity at least m. In certain cases, for m not too large compared with n, the new bound implies a bound conjectured by Nagata.
This is an attempt towards the understanding of the (birational) Kaehler cone of a compact hyperkaehler manifold in terms of the Beauville-Bogomolov form on its second cohomology. We discuss birational correspondences between hyperkaehler manifolds and their effects on the cohomology. Many of the results are conjectural in as much as they depend on a projectivity criterion for compact hyperkaehler manifolds contained in this paper's predecessor, but in which a serious mistake has oocured. An erratum is given in Sect. 6 and a way to rescue the approach is proposed in Sect. 7.
We use stable maps, and their stable lifts to the Semple bundle variety of second-order curvilinear data, to calculate certain characteristic numbers for rational plane curves. These characteristic numbers involve first-order (tangency) and second-order (inflectional) conditions. Although they may be virtual, they may be used as inputs in an enumeratively significant formula for the number of rational curves having a triple contact with a specified plane curve and passing through 3d-3 general points.
A smooth rational surface X is a Coble surface if the anti-canonical linear system is empty while the anti-bicanonical linear system is non-empty. In this note we shall classify these X and consider the finiteness problem of the number of negative curves on X modulo automorphisms.
We prove the following: (a) Let X be a smooth, codimension two subvariety of P6. If X lies on a hyperquintic or if deg(X)<74, then X is a complete intersection. (b) Let X be a smooth, subcanonical threefold in P5. If X lies on a hyperquartic, then X is a complete intersection.
Nondegenerate plane congruences in the four-dimensional complex projective space with degenerate general focal conic are classified by using the focal method due to Corrado Segre.
We study second order focal loci of nondegenerate plane congruences in P4(C) with degenerate focal conic. We show the projective generation of such congruences when the second order focal locus fills a component of the focal conic, improving a result of Corrado Segre
We explore the role played by the spectral curves associated with Higgs pairs in the context of the Nahm transform of doubly-periodic instantons defined in "Construction of doubly-periodic instantons" (math.DG/9909069) and "Nahm transform for doubly-periodic instantons" (math.DG/9910120). More precisely, we show how to construct a triple consisting of an algebraic curve plus a line bundle with connection over it from a doubly-periodic instanton, and that these coincide with the Hitchin's spectral data associated with the Nahm transformed Higgs bundle.
We calculate the Euler characteristics of the local systems S^k(V) \otimes S^l\Wedge^2(V) on the moduli space M_2 of curves of genus 2, where V is the rank 4 local system R^1\pi_*C.
First, we classify Calabi-Yau threefolds with infinite fundamental group by means of their minimal splitting coverings introduced by Beauville, and deduce that the nef cone is a rational simplicial cone and any rational nef divisor is semi-ample if the second Chern class is identically zero. We also derive a sufficient condition for the fundamental group to be finite in terms of the Picard number in an optimal form. Next, we give a concrete structure Theorem concerning $c_{2}$-contractions of Calabi-Yau threefolds as a generalisation and also a correction of our earlier works for simply connected ones. Finally, as an application, we show the finiteness of the isomorphism classes of $c_{2}$-contractions of each Calabi-Yau threefold.
In this paper, we prove the rationality of Igusa's local zeta functions of semiquasihomogeneous polynomials with coefficients in a non-archimedean local field K. The proof of this result is based on Igusa's stationary phase formula and some ideas on Neron p-desingularization.
In the 1960s, Dwork developed a p-adic cohomology theory of de Rham type for varieties over finite fields, based on a trace formula for the action of a Frobenius operator on certain spaces of p-adic analytic functions. One can consider a purely algebraic analogue of Dwork's theory for varieties over a field of characteristic zero and ask what is the connection between this theory and ordinary de Rham cohomology. N. Katz showed that Dwork cohomology coincides with the primitive part of de Rham cohomology for smooth projective hypersurfaces, but the exact relationship for varieties of higher codimension has been an open question. In this article, we settle the case of smooth affine complete intersections.
Let S be a minimal surface of general type with $p_g(S)=0$ and such that the bicanonical map $\phi:S\to \pp^{K^2_S}$ is a morphism: then the degree of $\phi$ is at most 4 and if it is equal to 4 then $K^2_S\le 6$. Here we prove that if $K^2_S=6$ and $\deg \phi=4$ then S is a so-called {\em Burniat surface}.   In addition we show that minimal surfaces with $p_g=0$, $K^2=6$ and bicanonical map of degree 4 form a 4-dimensional irreducible connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type.
Let X be a projective curve of genus 2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. The Frobenius map on X induces a rational map on the moduli scheme of rank-2 bundles. We show that up to isomorphism, there is only one (up to tensoring by an order two line bundle) semi-stable vector bundle of rank 2 (with determinant equal to a theta characteristic) whose Frobenius pull-back is not semi-stable. The indeterminacy of the Frobenius map at this point can be resolved by introducing Higgs bundles.
Let F be a polarized irreducible holomorphic symplectic fourfold, deformation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme parametrizing length-two zero-dimensional subschemes of a K3 surface. The homology group H^2(F,Z) is equipped with an integral symmetric nondegenerate form, the Beauville form. We give precise conjectures for the structure of the cone of effective curves - and by duality - the cone of ample divisors. Formally they are completely analogous to the results known for K3 surfaces, and they are expressed entirely in terms of the integers represented by the Beauville form restricted to Pic(F). We prove that these conjectures are true in an open subset of the moduli space using deformation theory.   The Fano variety of lines contained in a cubic fourfold is an example of a holomorphic symplectic fourfold. Our conjectures imply many concrete geometric statements about cubic fourfolds which may be verified using projective geometry.
The method of Lagrange multipliers relates the critical points of a given function f to the critical points of an auxiliary function F. We establish a cohomological relationship between f and F and use it, in conjunction with the Eagon-Northcott complex, to compute the sum of the Milnor numbers of the critical points in certain situations.
Let X be a smooth hypersurface in projective space. We discuss in this paper when X can be defined by an equation det M = 0 (resp. pf M = 0), where M is a matrix (resp. a skew-symmetric matrix) with homogeneous entries. Standard homological algebra methods show that this is equivalent to produce a line bundle (resp. a rank 2 vector bundle) E of a certain type on X . We discuss a number of applications for hypersurfaces of small dimension. An Appendix by F.-O. Schreyer proves (using Macaulay 2) that a general form of degree d in P^3 (resp. P^4) can be written as the pfaffian of a skew-symmetric (2d)x(2d) matrix with linear entries in the expected range, that is d < 16 (resp. d < 6).
Let $G$ be an algebraic group, $X$ a generically free $G$-variety, and $K=k(X)^G$. A field extension $L$ of $K$ is called a splitting field of $X$ if the image of the class of $X$ under the natural map $H^1(K, G) \mapsto H^1(L, G)$ is trivial. If $L/K$ is a (finite) Galois extension then $\Gal(L/K)$ is called a splitting group of $X$.   We prove a lower bound on the size of a splitting field of $X$ in terms of fixed points of nontoral abelian subgroups of $G$. A similar result holds for splitting groups. We give a number of applications, including a new construction of noncrossed product division algebras.
For a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g > 1$, $\Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1)$ is the moduli space of flat $\U(p,1)$-connections on $X$. There is an integer invariant, $\tau$, the Toledo invariant associated with each element in $\Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1)$. If $q = 1$, then $-2(g-1) \le \tau \le 2(g-1)$. This paper shows that $\Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1)$ has one connected component corresponding to each $\tau \in 2Z$ with $-2(g-1) \le \tau \le 2(g-1)$. Therefore the total number of connected components is $2(g-1) + 1$.
We prove the boundedness theorem for Fano threefolds with log-terminal singularities of any fixed index. This is an improvement of our earlier result, where we required additionally that the variety is Q-factorial, with Picard number 1. The new ideas of the paper include the following.   1. Using Alexeev Minimal Model program with suitable boundary to find horizontal extremal contractions.   2. Using Koll\'ar's effective Base Point Freeness theorem.   3. Using Kawamata's result on the length of extremal curves with suitable boundary to avoid gluing curves in some cases.
We study some properties of the natural action of $SL(V_0) \times...\times SL(V_p)$ on nondegenerate multidimensional complex matrices $A\in\P (V_0\otimes...\otimes V_p)$ of boundary format(in the sense of Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky); in particular we characterize the non stable ones,as the matrices which are in the orbit of a "triangular" matrix, and the matrices with a stabilizer containing $\C^*$, as those which are in the orbit of a "diagonal" matrix. For $p=2$ it turns out that a non degenerate matrix $A\in\P (V_0\otimes V_1\otimes V_2)$ detects a Steiner bundle $S_A$ (in the sense of Dolgachev and Kapranov) on the projective space $\P^{n}, n = dim (V_2)-1$. As a consequence we prove that the symmetry group of a Steiner bundle is contained in SL(2) and that the SL(2)-invariant Steiner bundles are exactly the bundles introduced by Schwarzenberger [Schw], which correspond to "identity" matrices. We can characterize the points of the moduli space of Steiner bundles which are stable for the action of $Aut(\P^n)$, answering in the first nontrivial case a question posed by Simpson.   In the opposite direction we obtain some results about Steiner bundles which imply properties of matrices. For example the number of unstable hyperplanes of $S_A$ (counting multiplicities) produces an interesting discrete invariant of $A$, which can take the values $0, 1, 2, ... ,\dim~V_0+1$ or $ \infty$; the $\infty$ case occurs if and only if $S_A$ is Schwarzenberger (and $A$ is an identity).   Finally, the Gale transform for Steiner bundles introduced by Dolgachev and Kapranov under the classical name of association can be understood in this setting as the transposition operator on multidimensional matrices.
We construct a smooth symmetric compactification of the space of all labeled tetrahedra in P^3.
In Comm. Math. Physics 118 (1988), 651-701, A. Beilinson and V. Schechtman define on the total space of a smooth family of curves a so-called trace complex associated to a vector bundle, the 0-th relative cohomology of which is the Atiyah algebra of the determinant bundle. Their proof reduces the general case to the acyclic one. In particular, one needs a comparison of the image of the trace complex for a bundle, and its twist by an \'etale multisection. We analyse this and correct a point in the original proof.
The Abel-Jacobi maps of the families of elliptic quintics and rational quartics lying on a smooth cubic threefold are studied. It is proved that their generic fiber is the 5-dimensional projective space for quintics, and a smooth 3-dimensional variety birational to the cubic itself for quartics. The paper is a continuation of the recent work of Markushevich-Tikhomirov, who showed that the first Abel-Jacobi map factors through the moduli component of stable rank 2 vector bundles on the cubic threefold with Chern numbers $c_1=0, c_2=2$ obtained by Serre's construction from elliptic quintics, and that the factorizing map from the moduli space to the intermediate Jacobian is \'etale. The above result implies that the degree of the \'etale map is 1, hence the moduli component of vector bundles is birational to the intermediate Jacobian. As an applicaton, it is shown that the generic fiber of the period map of Fano varieties of degree 14 is birational to the intermediate Jacobian of the associated cubic threefold.
In this paper we give a characterization of the height of K3 surfaces in positive characteristic. This enables us to calculate the cycle classes of the loci in families of K3 surfaces where the height is at least h. The formulas for such loci can be seen as generalizations of the famous formula of Deuring for the number of supersingular elliptic curves in positive characteristic. In order to describe the tangent spaces to these loci we study the first cohomology of higher closed forms.
A 10-dimensional symplectic moduli space of torsion sheaves on the cubic 4-fold is constructed. It parametrizes the stable rank 2 vector bundles on the hypeplane sections of the cubic 4-fold which are obtained by Serre's construction from normal elliptic quintics. The natural projection to the dual projective 5-space parametrizing the hyperplane sections is a Lagrangian fibration. The symplectic structure is closely related (and conjecturally, is equal) to the quasi-symplectic one, induced by the Yoneda pairing on the moduli space.
The following ``Key Lemma'' plays an important role in Parusinski's work on the existence of Lipschitz stratifications in the class of semianalytic sets: For any positive integer n, there is a finite set of homogeneous symmetric polynomials W_1,...,W_N in Z[x_1,...,x_n] and a constant M >0 such that |dx_i/x_i| \le M \max_{j = 1,..., N} |dW_j/W_j| as densely defined functions on the tangent bundle of C^n. We give a new algebro-geometric proof of this result.
A minimal surface of general type with $p_g(S)=0$ satisfies $1\le K^2\le 9$ and it is known that the image of the bicanonical map $\fie$ is a surface for $K_S^2\geq 2$, whilst for $K^2_S\geq 5$, the bicanonical map is always a morphism. In this paper it is shown that $\fie$ is birational if $K_S^2=9$ and that the degree of $\fie$ is at most 2 if $K_S^2=7$ or $K_S^2=8$.   By presenting two examples of surfaces $S$ with $K_S^2=7$ and 8 and bicanonical map of degree 2, it is also shown that this result is sharp. The example with $K_S^2=8$ is, to our knowledge, a new example of a surface of general type with $p_g=0$.
We extend the notion of the spectrum of semistable rank two bundles (initially constructed on ${\bf P}^3$ by Barth and Elencwajg) to a certain class of compact complex algebraic threefolds.
Suppose that $f: Y\to X$ is a proper, dominant, tamely ramified morphism of algebraic surfaces, over a perfect field. We show that it is possible to perform sequences of monoidal transforms $Y'\to Y$ and $X'\to X$ to obtain an induced morphism $Y'\to Y$ which is a monomial morphism.
The following divisors in the space Sym^{12} P^1 of twelve points on P^1 are actually the same: (A) the possible locus of the twelve nodal fibers in a rational elliptic fibration (i.e. a pencil of plane cubic curves); (B) degree 12 binary forms that can be expressed as a cube plus a square; (C) the locus of the twelve tangents to a smooth plane quartic from a general point of the plane; (D) the branch locus of a degree 4 map from a hyperelliptic genus 3 curve to P^1; (E) the branch locus of a degree 3 map from a genus 4 curve to P^1 induced by a theta-characteristic; and several more.   The corresponding moduli spaces are smooth, but they are not all isomorphic; some are finite etale covers of others. We describe the web of interconnections between these spaces, and give monodromy, rationality, and Prym-related consequences. Enumerative consequences include: (i) the degree of this locus is 3762 (e.g. there are 3762 rational elliptic fibrations with nodes above 11 given general points of the base); (ii) if C --> P^1 is a cover as in (D), then there are 135 different such covers branched at the same points; (iii) the general set of 12 tangent lines that arises in (C) turns up in 120 essentially different ways.   Some parts of this story are well-known, and some other parts were known classically (to Zeuthen, Zariski, Coble, Mumford, and others). The unified picture is surprisingly intricate and connects many beautiful constructions, including Recillas' trigonal construction and Shioda's E8-Mordell-Weil lattice.
We associate canonical virtual motives to definable sets over a field of characteristic zero. We use this construction to show that very general p-adic integrals are canonically interpolated by motivic ones.
We express the kernel of Griffiths' Abel-Jacobi map by using the inductive limit of Deligne cohomology in the generalized sense (i.e. the absolute Hodge cohomology of A. Beilinson). This generalizes a result of L. Barbieri-Viale and V. Srinivas in the surface case. We then show that the Abel-Jacobi map for codimension 2 cycles and the Albanese map are bijective if a general hyperplane section is a surface for which Bloch's conjecture is proved. In certain cases we verify Nori's conjecture on the Griffiths group. We also prove a weak Lefschetz-type theorem for (higher) Chow groups, generalize a formula for the Abel-Jacobi map of higher cycles due to Beilinson and Levine to the smooth non proper case, and give a sufficient condition for the nonvanishing of the transcendental part of the image by the Abel-Jacobi map of a higher cycle on an elliptic surface, together with some examples.
We introduce complex singularity exponents of plurisubharmonic functions and prove a general semi-continuity result for them. This concept contains as a special case several similar concepts which have been considered e.g. by Arnold and Varchenko, mostly for the study of hypersurface singularities. The plurisubharmonic version is somehow based on a reduction to the algebraic case, but it also takes into account more quantitative informations of great interest for complex analysis and complex differential geometry. We give as an application a new derivation of criteria for the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on certain Fano orbifolds, following Nadel's original ideas (but with a drastic simplication in the technique, once the semi-continuity result is taken for granted). In this way, 3 new examples of rigid K\"ahler-Einstein Del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities are obtained.
This paper studies hypersurface exceptional singularities in $\mathbb C^n$ defined by non-degenerate function. For each canonical hypersurface singularity, there exists a weighted homogeneous singularity such that the former is exceptional if and only if the latter is exceptional. So we study the weighted homogeneous case and prove that the number of weights of weighted homogeneous exceptional singularities are finite. Then we determine all exceptional singularities of the Brieskorn type of dimension 3.
We consider birational projective contractions f:X -> Y from a smooth symplectic variety X over the complex numbers. We first show that exceptional rational curves on X deform in a family of dimension at least 2n-2. Then we show that these contractions are generically coisotropic, provided X is projective. Then we specialize to contractions with 1-dimensional exceptional fibres. We classify them in a natural way in terms of (\Gamma, G), where \Gamma is a Dynkin diagram of type A_l, D_l or E_l and G is a permutation group of automorphisms of \Gamma. The 1-dimensional fibres do not degenerate, except if the contraction is of type (A_{2l},S_2). In that case they do not degenerate in codimension 1. Furthermore we show that the normalization of any irreducible component of Sing(Y) is a symplectic variety. We also provide examples for contractions of any type (\Gamma, G).
A generic quartic 3-fold X admits a 7-dimensional family of representations as the Pfaffian of an 8 by 8 skew-symmetric matrix of linear forms. This provides a 7-dimensional moduli space M of rank 2 vector bundles on X. A precise geometric description of a 14-dimensional family of half-canonical curves C of genus 15 in X such that the above vector bundles are obtained by Serre's construction from C is given. It is proved that the Abel-Jacobi map of this family factors through M, and the resulting map from M to the intermediate Jacobian is quasi-finite. In particular, every component of M has non-negative Kodaira dimension. Some other constructions of rank 2 vector bundles with small Chern classes are discussed; it is proved that the smallest possible charge of an instanton on X is 4.
We define a certain compactifiction of the general linear group and give a modular description for its points with values in arbitrary schemes. This is a first step in the construction of a higher rank generalization of Gieseker's degeneration of moduli spaces of vector bundles over a curve. We show that our compactification has similar properties as the ``wonderful compactification'' of algebraic groups of adjoint type as studied by de Concini and Procesi. As a byproduct we obtain a modular description of the points of the wonderful compactification of $\text{PGl}_n$.
We give formulas for the Dolbeault numbers of \Mbar_{3,1}, using the first author's calculations of the weights of the cohomology of M_{2,2} and M_{2,3} and the second author's calculation of the weights of the cohomology of M_{3,1}.
In this paper we show a general method to compactify certain open varieties by adding normal crossing divisors. This is done by proving that {\it blowing up along an arrangement of subvarieties} can be carried out. Important examples such as Ulyanov's configuration spaces, spaces of holomorphic maps, etc., are covered. Intersection ring and (non-recursive) Hodge polynomails are computed. Further general structures arising from the blowup process are described and studied.
We construct examples of non-projective normal proper algebraic surfaces and discuss the pathological behaviour of their Neron-Severi group. Our surfaces are birational to the product of a projective line and a curve of higher genus.
Let \alpha be a Schur root; let h=hcf_v(\alpha(v)) and let p = 1 - < \alpha/h,\alpha/h >. Then a moduli space of representations of dimension vector \alpha is birational to p h by h matrices up to simultaneous conjugacy. Therefore, if h=1,2,3 or 4, then such a moduli space is a rational variety and if h divides 420 it is a stably rational variety.
The purpose of this paper is to give basic tools for the classification of nonsingular toric Fano varieties by means of the notions of primitive collections and primitive relations due to Batyrev. By using them we can easily deal with equivariant blow-ups and blow-downs, and get an easy criterion to determine whether a given nonsingular toric variety is a Fano variety or not. As applications of these results, we get a toric version of a theorem of Mori, and can classify, in principle, all nonsingular toric Fano varieties obtained from a given nonsingular toric Fano variety by finite successions of equivariant blow-ups and blow-downs through nonsingular toric Fano varieties. Especially, we get a new method for the classification of nonsingular toric Fano varieties of dimension at most four. These methods are extended to the case of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties endowed with natural resolutions of singularities. Especially, we easily get a new method for the classification of Gorenstein toric Fano surfaces.
Let X be a projective geometrically irreducible non-singular algebraic curve defined over a finite field F of order $q^2$. If the number of F-rational points of X satisfies the Hasse-Weil upper bound, then X is said to be F-maximal. For a point P_0\in X(F), let \pi be the morphism arising from the linear series D:=|(q+1)P_0|, and let N:=dim(D). It is known that N\ge 2 and that \pi is independent of P_0 whenever X is F-maximal. The following theorems will be proved:   Theorem 0.1: If X is F-maximal, then \pi:X\to \pi(X) is a F-isomorphism. The non-singular model \pi(X) has degree q+1 and lies on a Hermitian variety defined over F of P^N(\bar F);   Theorem 0.2: If X is F-maximal, then it is F-isomorphic to a curve Y in P^M(\bar F), with 2\le M\le N, such that Y has degree q+1 and lies on a non-degenerate Hermitian variety defined over F of \P^M(\bar F). Furthermore, Aut_F(X) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the projective unitary group PGU(M+1,q^2);   Theorem 0.3: If X is F-birational to a curve Y embedded in P^M(\bar F) such that Y has degree q+1 and lies on a non-degenerate Hermitian variety defined over F of P^M(\bar F), then X is F-maximal and X is F-isomorphic to Y.
In this paper, a family of smooth multiply connected Calabi--Yau threefolds is investigated. The family presents a counterexample to global Torelli as conjectured by Aspinwall and Morrison.
We sharpen the two main tools used to treat the compactified Jacobian of a singular curve: Abel maps and presentation schemes. First we prove a smoothness theorem for bigraded Abel maps. Second we study the two complementary filtrations provided by the images of certain Abel maps and certain presentation schemes. Third we study a lifting of the Abel map of bidegree (m,1) to the corresponding presentation scheme. Fourth we prove that, if a curve is blown up at a double point, then the corresponding presentation scheme is a IP^1-bundle. Finally, using Abel maps of bidegree (m,1), we characterize the curves having double points at worst
We prove the following autoduality theorem for an integral projective curve C in any characteristic. Given an invertible sheaf L of degree 1, form the corresponding Abel map A_L: C->J, which maps C into its compactified Jacobian, and form its pullback map A_L^*: Pic^0_J to J, which carries the connected component of 0 in the Picard scheme back to the Jacobian. If C has, at worst, points of multiplicity 2, then A_L^* is an isomorphism, and forming it commutes with specializing C.   Much of our work is valid, more generally, for a family of curves with, at worst, points of embedding dimension 2. In this case, we use the determinant of cohomology to construct a right inverse to A_L^*. Then we prove a scheme-theoretic version of the theorem of the cube, generalizing Mumford's, and use it to prove that A_L^* is independent of the choice of L. Finally, we prove our autoduality theorem: we use the presentation scheme to achieve an induction on the difference between the arithmetic and geometric genera; here, we use a few special properties of points of multiplicity 2.
We show how to use information about the equations defining secant varieties to smooth projective varieties in order to construct a natural collection of birational transformations. These were first constructed as flips in the case of curves by M. Thaddeus via Geometric Invariant Theory, and the first flip in the sequence was constructed by the author for varieties of arbitrary dimension in an earlier paper. We expose the finer structure of a second flip; again for varieties of arbitrary dimension. We also prove a result on the cubic generation of the secant variety and give some conjectures on the behavior of equations defining the higher secant varieties.
We study the parametrization of the moduli space Bun_2(C)_L of rank 2 bundles over a curve C with fixed determinant, provided by Hecke modifications at fixed points of the trivial bundle. This parametrization is closely related to the Tyurin parametrization of vector bundles over curves. We use it to parametrize the Hitchin and KZB systems, as well as lifts of the Beilinson-Drinfeld D-modules. We express a generating series for the lifts of the Beilinson-Drinfeld operators in terms of a "quantum L-operator" \ell(z). We explain the relation to earlier joint work with G. Felder, based on parametrization by flags of bundles (math/9807145) and introduce filtrations on conformal blocks, related with the Hecke modifications.
In 70's there was discovered a construction how to attach to some algebraic-geometric data an infinite-dimensional subspace in the space k((z)) of the Laurent power series. The construction was successfully used in the theory of integrable systems, particularly, for the KP and KdV equations. There were also found some applications to the moduli of algebraic curves. But there remained a hard restriction by the case of curves, so by dimension 1. Recently, it was pointed out by the author that there are some connections between the theory of the KP-equations and the theory of n-dimensional local fields. From this point of view it becomes clear that the Krichever construction should have a generalization to the case of higher dimensions. This generalization is suggested in the paper for the case of algebraic surfaces.
We study the notion of non-commumative higher dimensional local fields. A simplest example is the ring P of formal pseudo- differential operators. As an application we extend the KP hierarchy to the space $P^n$.
Vladimir Shpilrain and Jie-Tai Yu have asked for an effective algorithm to decide if two elements of C[x,y] are related by an automorphism of C[x,y]. We describe here an efficient algorithm that decides this question and finds the automorphism if it exists. The algorithm is due to the second author, who described it in terms of Newton polygons, with C replaceable by a field of any characteristic. Here we describe it in terms of splice diagrams, which gains some efficiency at cost of generality (it currently applies only to characteristic zero). Part of the purpose of this paper is to give an exposition of the use of splice diagrams in studying C[x,y].
We show the density of the jumping loci of the Picard number of a hyperk\"ahler manifold under small deformation and provide several applications. In particular, we apply this to reveal the structure of hierarchy among all the narrow Mordell-Weil lattices of Jacobian K3 surfaces.
We develop a formalism of direct images for metrized vector bundles in the context of the non-archimedean Arakelov theory introduced in our previous joint work with S. Bloch, and we prove a Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem for this direct image.
We characterize contractible curves on proper normal algebraic surfaces in terms of complementary Weil divisors. Using this we generalize the classical criteria of Castelnuovo and Artin. As application we derive a finiteness result on homogeneous spectra defined by Weil divisors on surfaces.
In this paper we give a lower bound for the codimension of the Andreotti-Mayer loci in the moduli space of principally polarized complex abelian varieties. We also present a conjecture on this codimension.
We prove some lower bounds on certain twists of the canonical bundle of a codimension-2 subvariety of a generic hypersurface in projective space. In particular we prove that the generic sextic threefold contains no rational or elliptic curves and no nondegenerate curves of genus 2.
We classify singular fibres over general points of the discriminant locus of projective complex Lagrangian fibrations on 4-dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifolds. The singular fibre F is the following either one: F is isomorphic to the product of an elliptic curve and a Kodaira singular fibre up to finite unramified covering or F is a normal crossing variety consisting of several copies of a minimal elliptic ruled surface of which the dual graph is Dynkin diagram of type A_n, $\tilde{A_n}$, $\tilde{D_n}$ or D_n.
Let M be a quasiprojective algebraic manifold with K_M=0 and G a finite automorphism group of M acting trivially on the canonical class K_M; for example, a subgroup G of SL(n,C) acting on C^n in the obvious way. We aim to study the quotient variety X=M/G and its resolutions Y -> X (especially under the assumption that Y has K_Y=0) in terms of G-equivariant geometry of M. At present we know 4 or 5 quite different methods of doing this, taken from string theory, algebraic geometry, motives, moduli, derived categories, etc.   For G in SL(n,C) with n=2 or 3, we obtain several methods of cobbling together a basis of the homology of Y consisting of algebraic cycles in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes or the irreducible representations of G.
We prove that every irreducible component of a fibre of a complex Lagrangian fibration is Lagrangian subvariety.  Especially, complex Lagrangian fibations are equidimensional.
We use the geometry of the secant variety to an embedded smooth curve to prove some vanishing and regularity theorems for powers of ideal sheaves.
By associating a `motivic integral' to every complex projective variety X with at worst canonical, Gorenstein singularities, Kontsevich proved that, when there exists a crepant resolution of singularities Y of X, the Hodge numbers of Y do not depend upon the choice of the resolution. In this article we provide an elementary introduction to the theory of motivic integration, leading to a proof of the result described above. We calculate the motivic integral of several quotient singularities and discuss these calculations in the context of the cohomological McKay correspondence.
Let X be a quasiprojective smooth surface defined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. We show that if X is Frobenius split then so is the Hilbert scheme Hilb^n(X) of n points in X. In particular, we get the higher cohomology vanishing for ample line bundles on Hilb^n(X) when X is projective and Frobenius split.
Locally analytically, any isolated double point occurs as a double covering of a smooth surface. It can be desingularized via the canonical resolution, as it is well-known. In this paper we explicitly compute the fundamental cycle of both the canonical and minimal resolution of a double point singularity and we classify those for which the fundamental cycle differs from the fiber cycle. Finally we compute the conditions that a double point imposes to pluricanonical systems.
We prove that the moduli space of mathematical instanton bundles on ${\Bbb P}^3$ with $c_2=5$ is smooth.
The goal of this paper is the presentation of an ``embedded resolution'' of ({f(x,y)+z^2=0},0) \subset (C^3,0) using the method of Jung.
Let $\sE$ be an ample rank $r$ bundle on a smooth toric projective surface, $S$, whose topological Euler characteristic is $e(S)$. In this article, we prove a number of surprisingly strong lower bounds for $c_1(\sE)^2$ and $c_2(\sE)$. We also enumerate the exceptions to either the inequality $c_1(\sE)^2\ge 4e(S)$ or the inequality $c_2(\sE)\ge e(S)$ holding.
Roughly speaking, a conic bundle is a surface, fibered over a curve, such that the fibers are conics (not necessarily smooth). We define stability for conic bundles and construct a moduli space. We prove that (after fixing some invariants) these moduli spaces are irreducible (under some conditions). Conic bundles can be thought of as generalizations of orthogonal bundles on curves. We show that in this particular case our definition of stability agrees with the definition of stability for orthogonal bundles. Finally, in an appendix by I. Mundet i Riera, a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence is stated for conic bundles.
This is an expository article on the theory of algebraic stacks. After introducing the general theory, we concentrate in the example of the moduli stack of vector budles, giving a detailed comparison with the moduli scheme obtained via geometric invariant theory.
We discuss the rigidity problem for Mori fibrations on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1, 2 and 3 over ${\mathbb P}^1$ and formulate the following conjecture: such a del Pezzo fibration $V/{\mathbb P}^1$ is birationally rigid if and only if its quasi-effective and adjunction thresholds coincide. We prove the "only if" part of this conjecture.
In this paper we prove two results concerning the classification of Siegel modular threefolds. Let A_{1,d}(n) be the moduli space of abelian surfaces with a (1,d)-polarization and a full level-n structure and let A_{1,d}^{lev}(n) be the space where one has fixed an additional canonical level structure. We prove that A_{1,d}(n) is of general type if (d,n)=1 and n ist at least 4. This is the best possible result which one can prove for all d simultaneously. Let p be an odd prime and assume that (p,n)=1. Then we prove that the Voronoi compactification of A_{1,p}^{lev}(n) is smooth and has ample canonical bundle if and only if n is greater than or equal to 5.
Let X be as smooth complex projective variety with Neron-Severi group isomorphic to Z, and D an irreducible divisor with normal crossing singularities. Assume r is equal to 2 or 3. We prove that if the fundamental group of X doesn't have irreducible PU(r) representations, then the fundamental group of X-D doesn't have irreducible U(r) representations. The proof uses the non-existence of certain stable parabolic bundles. We also obtain a similar result for GL(2) when D is smooth and X is a complex surface.
Let $f: X \to S$ be a smooth morphism in characteristic 0, and let $(E, \nabla_{X/S})$ be a relative regular connection. We define a cohomology of relative differential characters on $X$ which receives classes of $(E, \nabla_{X/S})$. It says in particular that the partial vanishing of the trace of the iterated Atiyah classs can be made canonical. While applied to a family of curves and $c_2$, the construction yields a connection of $f_*c_2(E)$. This one has been constructed analytically by A. Beilinson. We also relate our construction to the trace complex of Beilinson of Schechtman.
We construct all codimension 1 multi-germs of maps (k^n,T)-->(k^p,0) with n > p-2, (n,p) nice dimensions, k = R or C, by augmentation and concetenation operations, starting from mon-germs (|T|=1). As an application, we prove general results for multi-germs of corank <2: every one has a real form with real perturbation carrying the vanishing homology of the complexification, every one is quasihomogeneous, and when n=p-1 every one has image Milnor number equal to 1 (the comparable result for n>p-1 being already known).
It is withdrawn because of errors.
The paper deals with the configuration of subalgebras in generic $n$-dimensional $k$-argument anticommutative algebras and ``regular'' anticommutative algebras.
Let $\mathcal N$ be the moduli space of sextics with 3 (3,4)-cusps. The quotient moduli space ${\mathcal N}/G$ is one-dimensional and consists of two components, ${\mathcal N}_{torus}/G$ and ${\mathcal N}_{gen}/G$. By quadratic transformations, they are transformed into one-parameter families $C_s$ and $D_s$ of cubic curves respectively. We study the Mordell-Weil torsion groups of cubic curves $C_s$ over $\bfQ$ and $D_s$ over $\bfQ(\sqrt{-3})$ respectively. We show that $C_{s}$ has the torsion group $\bf Z/3\bf Z$ for a generic $s\in \bf Q$ and it also contains subfamilies which coincide with the universal families given by Kubert with the torsion groups  $\bf Z/6\bf Z$, $\bf Z/6\bf Z+\bf Z/2\bf Z$, $\bf Z/9\bf Z$ or $\bf Z/12\bf Z$. The cubic curves $D_s$ has torsion $\bf Z/3\bf Z+\bf Z/3\bf Z$ generically but also $\bf Z/3\bf Z+\bf Z/6\bf Z$ for a subfamily which is parametrized by $ \bf Q(\sqrt{-3}) $.
Unitary representations of the fundamental group of a Kahler manifold correspond to polystable vector bundles (with vanishing Chern classes). Semisimple linear representations correspond to polystable Higgs bundles. In this paper we find the objects corresponding to affine representations: the linear part gives a Higgs bundle and the translation part corresponds to an element of a generalized de Rham cohomology.
Borrowing a reduction principle to a recent preprint of G. Faltings (toroidal resolution of some matrix singularities, 1999), we use Lafforgue's compactification of PGL_r^{N+1}/PGL_r to construct a canonical log-smooth toroidal resolution for the bad reduction in a prime p of Shimura varieties of unitary and symplectic type with parahoric level structures at p. Using this result, non-canonical semi-stable resolutions over Z_p[p^{1/\nu}] can be derived.
Suppose that X' is a smooth affine algebraic variety of dimension 3 with H_3(X')=0 which is a UFD and whose invertible functions are constants. Suppose that Z is a Zariski open subset of X which has a morphism p : Z -> U into a curve U such that all fibers of p are isomorphic to C^2. We prove that X' is isomorphic to C^3 iff none of irreducible components of X'-Z has non-isolated singularities. Furthermore, if X' is C^3 then p extends to a polynomial on C^3 which is linear in a suitable coordinate system. As a consequence we obtain the fact formulated in the title of the paper.
Consider a PEL-Shimura variety associated to a unitary group that splits over an unramified extension of Q_p. Rapoport and Zink have defined a model of the Shimura variety over the ring of integers of the completion of the reflex field at a place lying over p, with parahoric level structures at p. We show that this model is flat, as conjectured by Rapoport and Zink, and that its special fibre is reduced.
For any odd $n$, we describe a smooth minimal (i.e. obtained by adding an irreducible hypersurface) compactification $\tilde S_n$ of the quasi-projective homogeneous variety $S_{n}=PGL(n+1)/SL(2)$ that parameterizes the rational normal curves in $P^n$. We show that $\tilde S_{n}$ is isomorphic to a component of the Maruyama scheme of the semi-stable sheaves on $P^n$ of rank $n$ and Chern polynomial $(1+t)^{n+2}$ and we compute its Betti numbers.   In particular $\tilde S_{3}$ is isomorphic to the variety of nets of quadrics defining twisted cubics, studied by G. Ellinsgrud, R. Piene and S. Str{\o}mme (Space curves, Proc. Conf., LNM 1266).
Let $G$ be a reductive group, let $Gr=G((t))/G[[t]]$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian and let $Fl=G((t))/I$ be the affine flag variety. We construct, following an idea of Belinson, a 1-parametric deformation of the product $Gr\times G/B$ to $Fl$. We use this construction to produce perverse sheaves on $Fl$ which are central with respect to the convolution product from spherical perverse sheaves on $Gr$.
In this paper, we study rigidity of nonsingular del Pezzo fibrations over a germ of smooth curve.

The `linear orbit' of a plane curve of degree $d$ is its orbit in $\P^{d(d+3)/2}$ under the natural action of $\PGL(3)$. In this paper we obtain an algorithm computing the degree of the closure of the linear orbit of an arbitrary plane curve, and give explicit formulas for plane curves with irreducible singularities. The main tool is an intersection@-theoretic study of the projective normal cone of a scheme determined by the curve in the projective space $\P^8$ of $3\times 3$ matrices; this expresses the degree of the orbit closure in terms of the degrees of suitable loci related to the limits of the curve. These limits, and the degrees of the corresponding loci, have been established in previous work.
Gau{\ss}-Manin determinant connections associated to irregular connections on a curve are studied. The determinant of the Fourier transform of an irregular connection is calculated. The determinant of cohomology of the standard rank 2 Kloosterman sheaf is computed modulo 2 torsion. Periods associated to irregular connections are studied in the very basic $\exp(f)$ case, and analogies with the Gau{\ss}-Manin determinant are discussed.
We introduce a variant of the usual Kahler forms on free and almost free divisors and their deformations, and show that they enjoy the same depth properties as Kahler forms on isolated complete intersection singularities. Using these forms, it is possible to describe analytically the vanishing cohomology in families of free divisors, in precise analogy with the classical description for the Milnor fibration of an ICIS, due to Brieskorn and Greuel. This applies in par- ticular to the family of discriminants of a versal deformation of an unstable map-germ.
We study non-isotrivial projective families of elliptic surfaces of Kodaira dimension one, over complex projective curves. If the base is an elliptic curve, we show that the family must have a singular fibre, and that over the projective line it must have at least three singular fibres. Similar results, for families of surfaces of general type, have been obtained by Migliorini and Kov\'acs, and they are well-known for projective families of surfaces of Kodaira dimension zero. Revised version: We corrected some minor errors and ambiguities, and we completed the list of references.
We prove canonical isomorphisms between Spin Verlinde spaces, i.e, spaces of global sections of a determinant line bundle over the moduli space of semistable Spin-bundles over a smooth projective curve C, and the dual spaces of theta functions over Prym varieties of unramified double covers of C.
We study aspects related to Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture in the case of Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. In a 1996 lecture at Rutgers University, Kontsevich indicated how his proposal implies that the groups of automorphisms of the two types of categories involved in the homological mirror symmetry conjecture should also be identified. Our main results provide an explicit geometric construction of the correspondence between the automorphisms of the two types of categories.
The aim of these notes is to explain main ideas of the theory of complements. Basically we will follow Shokurov's work alg-geom/9711024.
We introduce symmetrizing operators of the polynomial ring $A[x]$ in the varible $x$ over a ring $A$. When $A$ is an algebra over a field $k$ these operators are used to characterize the monic polynomials $F(x)$ of degree $n$ in $A[x]$ such that $A\otimes_k k[x]_{(x)}/(F(x))$ is a free $A$-module of rank $n$. We use the characterization to determine the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes of length $n$ of $k[x]_{(x)}$.
Let $k[x]_{(x)}$ be the polynomial ring $k[x]$ localized in the maximal ideal $(x)\subseteq k[x]$. We study the Hilbert functor parameterizing ideals of colength $n$ in this ring {\it having support at the origin}. The main result of this article is that this functor is not representable. We also give a complete description of the functor as a limit of representable functors.
Let A[X]_U be a fraction ring of the polynomial ring A[X] in the variable X over a commutative ring A. We show that the Hilbert functor {Hilb}^n_{A[X]_U} is represented by an affine scheme $\text{Symm}^n_A(A[X]_U)$ give as the ring of symmetric tensors of $\otimes_A^nA[X]_U$. The universal family is given as $\text{Symm}^{n-1}_A(A[X]_U)\times_A \text{Spec}(A[X]_U)$.
The "peak reduction" method is a powerful combinatorial technique with applications in many different areas of mathematics as well as theoretical computer science. It was introduced by Whitehead, a famous topologist and group theorist, who used it to solve an important algorithmic problem concerning automorphisms of a free group. Since then, this method was used to solve numerous problems in group theory, topology, combinatorics, and probably in some other areas as well.   In this paper, we give a survey of what seems to be the first applications of the peak reduction technique in commutative algebra and affine algebraic geometry.
We construct inductively an equivariant compactification of the algebraic group ${\mathbb W}_n$ of Witt vectors of finite length over a field of characteristic $p>0$. We obtain smooth projective rational varieties $\bar{\mathbb W}_n$, defined over $\mathbf F_p$; the boundary is a divisor whose reduced subscheme has normal crossings.   The Artin-Schreier-Witt isogeny $F-1:{\mathbb W}_n\to {\mathbb W}_n$ extends to a finite cyclic cover ${\mathbf\Psi}_n:\bar{\mathbb W}_n\to \bar{\mathbb W}_n$ of degree $p^n$ ramified at the boundary. This is used to give an extrinsic description of the local behavior of a separable cover of curves in char. $p$ at a wildly ramified point whose inertia group is cyclic.   In an appendix, we give an elementary computation of the conductor of such a covering, which can otherwise be determined using class field theory.
Consequences of the Toda equations arising from the conjectural matrix model for the Riemann sphere are investigated. The Toda equations determine the Gromov-Witten descendent potential (including all genera) of the Riemann sphere from the degree 0 part. Degree 0 series computations via Hodge integrals then lead to higher degree predictions by the Toda equations. First, closed series forms for all 1-point invariants of all genera and degrees are given. Second, degree 1 invariants are investigated with new applications to Hodge integrals. Third, a differential equation for the generating function of the classical simple Hurwitz numbers (in all genera and degrees) is found -- the first such equation. All these results depend upon the conjectural Toda equations. Finally, proofs of the Toda equations in genus 0 and 1 are given.
In this paper we consider the stratification on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces in characteristic $p>0$ defined by the height of the formal group associated to $H^2(X,O_X)$. We compute the cycle classes of the strata and compare these with those of the $p$-rank stratification.
In this paper we determine all finite groups G that can act on some compact Riemann surface M with the property that if H is any non-trivial subgroup of G, then the orbit surface M/H is the Riemann sphere. The idea is to look at the induced action on the vector space of holomorphic differentials on M (in the positive genus case) and then use the old-known (Wolf) classification of groups admitting fixed point-free linear actions. A description of the corresponding group actions is given in terms of Fuchsian representations.
The goal of this paper is to make the vertex operator algebra approach to mirror symmetry accessible to algebraic geometers. Compared to better-known approaches using moduli spaces of stable maps and special Lagrangian fibrations, this approach follows more closely the original line of thinking that lead to the discovery of mirror symmetry by physicists. The ultimate goal of the vertex algebra approach is to give precise mathematical definitions of N=(2,2) superconformal field theories called A and B models associated to any Calabi-Yau variety and then show that thus constructed theories are related by the mirror involution for all known examples of mirror symmetric varieties.
This paper has been withdrawn by the author, due an error in the proof of Proposion 2.13.
The aim of this paper is to clarify and generalize techniques of works alg-geom/9711024 (see also math.AG/9810097 and math.AG/9901004). Roughly speaking, we prove that for local Fano contractions the existence of complements can be reduced to the existence of complements for lower dimensional projective Fano varieties.
For a finite set A of integral vectors, Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinskii defined a system of differential equations with a parameter vector as a D-module, which system is called an A-hypergeometric (or a GKZ hypergeometric) system. Classifying the parameters according to the D-isomorphism classes of their corresponding A-hypergeometric systems is one of the most fundamental problems in the theory. In this paper we give a combinatorial answer for the problem under the assumption that the finite set A lies in a hyperplane off the origin, and illustrate it in two particularly simple cases: the normal case and the monomial curve case.
Dropping separatedness in the definition of a toric variety, one obtains the more general notion of a toric prevariety. Toric prevarieties occur as ambient spaces in algebraic geometry and moreover they appear naturally as intermediate steps in quotient constructions. We first provide a complete description of the category of toric prevarieties in terms of convex-geometrical data, so-called systems of fans. In a second part, we consider actions of subtori H of the big torus of a toric prevariety X and investigate quotients for such actions. Using our language of systems of fans, we characterize existence of good prequotients for the action of H on X. Moreover, we show by means of an algorithmic construction that there always exists a toric prequotient for the action of H on X, that means an H-invariant toric morphism p from X to a toric prevariety Y such that every H-invariant toric morphism from X to a toric prevariety factors through p. Finally, generalizing a result of D. Cox, we prove that every toric prevariety occurs as the image of a categorical prequotient of an open toric subvariety of some complex affine space.
Any ample Cartier divisor D on a projective variety X is strictly nef (i.e. D.C>0 for any effective curve C on X). In general, the converse statement does not hold. But this is conjectured to be true for anticanonical divisors.  The present paper establishes this fact for normal complex projective threefolds with canonical singularities. This result extends several previously known special cases.  The proof rests mainly on sophisticated techniques of three dimensional birational geometry developed in the last two decades.
We establish a relation between the generating functions appearing in the S-duality conjecture of Vafa and Witten and geometric Eisenstein series for Kac-Moody groups. For a pair consisting of a surface and a curve on it, we consider a refined geometric function E (involving G-bundles with parabolic structures along the curve) which depends both on elliptic and modular variables. We prove a functional equation for E with respect to the affine Weyl group, thus establishing the elliptic behavior. When the curve is P^1, we calculate the Eisenstein-Kac-Moody series explicitly and it turns out to be a certain deformation of an irreducible Kac-Moody character, more precisely, an analog of the Hall-Littlewood polynomial for the affine root system. We also get an explicit formula for the universal blowup function for any simply connected structure group.
We develop an intersection theory for a singular hemitian line bundle with positive curvature current on a smooth projective variety and irreducible curves on the variety. And we prove the existence of a natural rational fibration structure associated with the singular hermitian line bundle. Also for any pseudoeffective line bundle on a smooth projective variety, we prove the existence of a rational natural fibration structure associated with the line bundle.   We also characterize a numerically trivial singular hermitain line bundle on a smooth projective variety.
The main result of this paper is the proof of the "transversal part" of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture for an elliptic curve which states an equivalence of two $A_{\infty}$-structures on the category of vector bundles on an elliptic curves. The proof is based on the study of $A_{\infty}$-structures on the category of line bundles over an elliptic curve satisfying some natural restrictions (in particular, $m_1$ should be zero, $m_2$ should coincide with the usual composition). The key observation is that such a structure is uniquely determined up to homotopy by certain triple products.
We extend a result of to Esnault-Levine-Viehweg concerning the Chow groups of hypersurfaces in projective space to those in weighted projective spaces.
This paper is withdrawn by the authors.
We prove an algebraic formula for the Euler characteristic of the Milnor fibres of functions with critical locus a smooth curve on a space which is a weighted homogeneous complete intersection with isolated singularity.
We classify irreducible d-semistable degenerations of primary Kodaira surfaces. As an application we construct a canonical completion for the moduli space of primary Kodaira surfaces.
Given an invertible sheaf, does it come from a Cartier divisor? This might fail in presence of embedded components. I give some examples and characterize those invertible sheaves that allow a Cartier divisor.
We express the Lefschetz number of iterates of the monodromy of a function on a smooth complex algebraic variety in terms of the Euler characteristic of a space of truncated arcs.
The goal of this article is to study the equations and syzygies of embeddings of rational surfaces and certain Fano varieties. Given a rational surface X and an ample and base-point-free line bundle L on X, we give an optimal numerical criterion for L to satisfy property Np. This criterion turns out to be a characterization of property Np if X is anticanonical. We also prove syzygy results for adjunction bundles and a Reider type theorem for higher syzygies.   For certain Fano varieties we also prove results on very ampleness and higher syzygies.
It is pretty well-known that toric Fano varieties of dimension k with terminal singularities correspond to convex lattice polytopes P in R^k of positive finite volume, such that intersection of P and Z^k consists of the point 0 and vertices of P. Likewise, Q-factorial terminal toric singularities essentially correspond to lattice simplexes with no lattice points inside or on the boundary (except the vertices). There have been a lot work, especially in the last 20 years or so on classification of these objects. The main goal of this paper is to bring together these and related results, that are currently scattered in the literature. We also want to emphasize the deep similarity between the problems of classification of toric Fano varieties and classification of Q-factorial toric singularities.
The Chisini conjecture asserts that a generic ramified covering over the complex projective plane of degree at least 5 is uniquely determined by its branch curve. We prove this for degree at least 12 using the work of Kulikov (math-AG/9803144).
Working over a perfect field, I classify normal del Pezzo surfaces with base number one that contain a nonrational singularity. They form a huge infinite hierarchy; contractions of ruled surfaces lie on top of it. Descending the hierarchy hinges on a generalized version of elementary transformations. As an application, I determine the structure of 2-dimensional anticanonical models for arbitrary normal surfaces.
We give some bounds on the anticanonical degrees of Fano varieties with Picard number 1 and mild singularities, extending results of Koll\'ar et al. from the early 90's and improving them even in the smooth case. The proof is based on a study of positivity properties of sheaves of differential operators on ample line bundles, and avoids the use of rational curves and bend-and-break. This note is a self-contained exposition of the main ideas of math.AG/9811022
We consider subtorus actions on divisorial toric varieties. Here divisoriality means that the variety has many Cartier divisors like quasiprojective and smooth ones. We characterize when a subtorus action on such a toric variety admits a categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties. Our result generalizes previous statements for the quasiprojective case. An important tool for the proof is a universal reduction of an arbitrary toric variety to a divisorial one. This is done in terms of support maps, a notion generalizing support functions on a polytopal fan. A further essential step is the decomposition of a given subtorus invariant regular map to a divisorial variety into an invariant toric part followed by a non-toric part.
We verify a special case of V. V. Shokurov's conjecture about characterization of toric varieties. More precisely, let $(X,D=\sum d_iD_i)$ be a three-dimensional log variety such that $K_X+D$ is numerically trivial and $(X,D)$ has only purely log terminal singularities. In this situation we prove the inequality \{center} $\sum d_i\le \rk\Weil(X)/(\operatorname{algebraic equivalence}) +\dim(X)$. \{center} We describe such pairs for which the equality holds and show that all of them are toric.
Given a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$ over the complex numbers, Torelli's thoerem asserts that the pair $(J(C),W^{g-1})$ determines $C$, where $W^{g-1}$ is an image of the $g-1$st symmetric power of $C$ inside the Jacobian under an Abel-Jacobi map. We show that the theorem holds with $g-1$ replaced by an integer $d$ in the range $1\le d\le g-1$.
We reproduce the quantum cohomology of toric varieties (and of some hypersurfaces in projective spaces) as the cohomology of certain vertex algebras with differential. The deformation technique allows us to compute the cohomology of the chiral de Rham complex over the projective space.
For an essential, central hyperplane arrangement A in V=k^{n+1}, we show that \Omega^1(A) (the module of logarithmic one forms with poles along A) gives rise to a locally free sheaf on P^n if and only if for all X in L_A with rank X<dim V, the module \Omega^1(A_X) is free. Our main result is that in this case the Poicare polynomial of A is essentially the Chern polynomial. The proof is based on a result of Solomon and Terao and on a formula we give for the Chern polynomial of a bundle E on P^n in terms of the Hilbert series of \oplus_m H^0(\wedge^iE(m)). If \Omega^1(A)has projective dimension one and is locally free, we give a minimal free resolution for \Omega^p, and show that \wedge^p(\Omega^1(A))\iso\Omega^p(A), generalizing results of Rose and Terao on generic arrangements.
We prove finiteness of the number of smooth blow-downs on Fano manifolds and boundedness results for the geometry of non projective Fano-like manifolds. Our proofs use properness of Hilbert schemes and Mori theory.
A line bundle with a base-point-free multiple is called semiample. I give a cohomological characterization of semiample line bundles. The result is a common generalization of the Fujita-Zariski criterion for semiampleness and the Grothendieck-Serre characterization of ampleness. Applying the Fujita-Zariski Theorem, I characterize contractible curves in 1-dimensional families.
Let X be a complex surface with no nontrivial 2-forms. Then we show that Bloch's conjecture is true (i.e. the Albanese map in this case is injective) if and only if any homologically trivial idempotent in the ring of correspondences vanishes. Furthermore the cube of the ideal of homologically trivial correspondences is zero if these equivalent conditions are satisfied (e.g. if X is not of general type).
In this paper we approach the study of generalized theta linear series on moduli of vector bundles on curves via vector bundle techniques on abelian varieties. We study what are called the Verlinde bundles in order to obtain information about duality between theta functions and effective global and normal generation on these moduli spaces.
We obtain effective results for the global generation of pluritheta line bundles on moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves. The main ingredient is an independent result giving an upper bound on the dimension of the Hilbert scheme of coherent quotients of a given vector bundle.
We continue our work on variations of graded-polarized mixed Hodge structures by defining analogs of the harmonic metric equations for filtered bundles and proving a precise analog of Schmid's Nilpotent Orbit Theorem for 1-parameter degenerations of graded-polarized mixed Hodge structure.
What kind of schemes are embeddable into good toric prevarieties? To shed some light on this question, we construct proper normal surfaces that are embeddable into neither simplicial toric prevarieties nor toric prevarieties of affine intersection.
We study the existence of $L^2$ holomorphic sections of invariant line bundles over Galois coverings of Zariski open sets in Moishezon manilolds. We show that the von Neuman dimension of the space of $L^2$ holomorphic sections is bounded below under reasonable curvature conditions. We also give criteria for a a compact complex space with isolated singularities and some related strongly pseudoconcave manifolds to be Moishezon. Their coverings are then studied with the same methods. As applications we give weak Lefschetz theorems using the Napier--Ramachandran proof of the Nori theorem.
In this note we study the moduli space of rank two semistable sheaves on a smooth cubic hypersurface $X\subset\mathbb{P}^{4}$ with $c_{1}=0$, $c_{2}=2$ and $c_{3}=0$. We show that it is isomorphic to the blow-up of the intermediate jacobian $J(X)$ of $X$ along the Fano surface of $X$. We complete previous results of Iliev-Markushevich AG/9910058 and Markushevich-Tikhomirov AG/9910063.
The moduli space of cubic surfaces in complex projective space is known to be isomorphic to the quotient of the complex 4-ball by a certain arithmetic group. We apply Borcherds' techniques to construct automorphic forms for this group and show that these provide an embedding of the moduli space in 9-dimensional projective space. We also show that our automorphic forms directly encode the geometry of cubic surfaces, by showing that each of Cayley's invariants (certain cross-ratios) is simply a quotient of two of our automorphic forms.
This is a note constructing a certain weight 4 automorphic form on the moduli space of cubic surfaces, posted here because it is referred to in math.AG/0002066
This is an expanded version of the notes for the lectures given by the author at RIMS in the summer of 1999 to give a detailed account of the proof for the (weak) factorization theorem of birational maps by Abramovich-Karu-Matsuki-W{\l}odarczyk.
We give examples for existence and non-existence of categorical quotients for algebraic group actions in the categories of algebraic varieties and prevarieties. All our examples are subtorus actions on toric varieties.
For a semistable reflexive sheaf $E$ of rank $r$ and $c_1=a$ on $\P^n$ and an integer $d$ such that $r|ad$, we give sufficient conditions so that the restriction of $E$ on a generic rational curve of degree $d$ is balanced, i.e. a twist of the trivial bundle (for instance, if $E$ has balanced restriction on a generic line, or $r=2$ or $E$ is an exterior power of the tangent bundle). Assuming this, we give a formula for the 'virtual degree', interpreted enumeratively, of the locus of rational curves of degree $d$ on which the restriction of $E$ is not balanced, generalizing a classical formula due to Barth for the degree of the divisor of jumping lines of a semistable rank-2 bundle.
An explicit projective embedding of the moduli space of marked cubic surfaces is given. This embedding is equivariant under the Weyl group of type E6. The image is defined by a system of linear and cubic equations. To express the embedding in a most symmetric way, the target would be 79-dimensional, however the image lies in a 9-dimensional linear subspace.
We make a systematic study of the focal surface of a congruence of lines in the projective space. Using differential techniques together with techniques from intersection theory, we reobtain in particular all the invariants of the focal surface (degree, class, class of its hyperplane section, sectional genus and degrees of the nodal and cuspidal curve). We study in particular the congruences of chords to a smooth curve and the congruences of bitangents or flexes to a smooth surface. We find that they possess unexpected components in their focal surface, and conjecture that they are the only ones with this property.
We describe a new perspective on the intersection theory of the moduli space of curves involving both Virasoro constraints and Gorenstein conditions. The main result of the paper is the computation of a basic 1-point Hodge integral series occurring in the tautological ring of the moduli space of nonsingular curves.   In the appendix by D. Zagier, "Polynomials arising from the tautological ring", a detailed study is made of certain polynomials whose coefficients are intersection numbers on moduli space. The paper and the appendix together provide proofs of all previously conjectured formulas for 1-point integrals in the tautological ring, and of natural extensions of these formulas as well.
Ran proved that smooth codimension 2 varieties in ${\bf P}^{m+2}$ are $j$-normal if $(j+1)(3j-1)\le m-1$, in this paper we extend this result to small codimension projective varieties. Let $X$ be a r codimension subvariety of $\pro$, we prove that if the set $\Sigma_{(j+1)}$ of $(j+1)$-secants to $X$ through a generic external point is not empty, $2(r+1)j\leq m-r$ and $(j+1)((r+1)j-1)\leq m-1$ then $X$ is $j$-normal. If $X$ is given by the zero locus of a section of a rank $r$ vector bundle $E$ on $\pro$, we prove that $\textrm{deg} \Sigma_{j+1}=\frac{1}{(j+1)!}\prod_{i=0}^{j}c_{r}(E(-i))$. Moreover we get a new simple proof of Zak's theorem on linear normality if $m\ge 3r$. Finally we prove that if $c_{r}(N(-2))\neq 0$ and $6r\le m-4$ then $X$ is 2-normal.
We study monodromy groups of elliptic fibrations over the projective line.
We study the general elements of the moduli spaces (\MM_{\PP^2} (r, c_1, c_2) ) of stable holomorphic vector bundle on $\PP^2$ and their minimal free resolution. Incidentally, a quite easy proof of the irreducibility of (\MM_{\PP^2} (r, c_1, c_2)) is shown.
We generalize results of the paper math.AG/9803144, in which Chisini's conjecture on the unique reconstruction of f by the curve B is investigated. For this fibre products of generic coverings are studied. The main inequality bounding the degree of a covering in the case of existence of two nonequivalent coverings with the branch curve B is obtained. This inequality is used for the proof of the Chisini conjecture for m-canonical coverings of surfaces of general type for $m\ge 5$.
The real intersection cohomology of a toric variety is described in a purely combinatorial way using methods of elementary commutative algebra only. We define, for arbitrary fans, the notion of a ``minimal extension sheaf'' on the fan as an axiomatic characterization of the equivariant intersection cohomology sheaf. This provides a purely algebraic interpretation of Stanley's generalized f- and g-vector of an arbitrary polytope or complete fan under a natural vanishing condition. -- The results presented in this note originate from joint work with G.Barthel, J.-P.Brasselet and L.Kaup, continuing earlier research (see math.AG/9904159). A detailed exposition will appear elsewhere (see math.AG/0002181).
Let Y be a projective non-singular curve of genus g, X a projective manifold, both defined over the field of complex numbers, and let f:X ---> Y be a surjective morphism with general fibre F.   If the Kodaira dimension of X is non-negative, and if Y is the projective line we show that f has at least 3 singular fibres.   In general, for non-isotrivial morphisms f, one expects that the number of singular fibres is at least 3, if g=0, or at least 1, if g=1. Using the strong additivity of the Kodaira dimension, this is verified, if either F is of general type, or if F has a minimal model with a semi-ample canonical divisor. The corresponding result has been obtained by Migliorini and Kovacs, for families of surfaces of general type and for families of canonically polarized manifolds, and by Oguiso-Viehweg for families of elliptic surfaces.   As a byproduct we obtain explicit bounds for the degree of the direct image of powers of the dualizing sheaf, generalizing those obtained by Bedulev-Viehweg for families of surfaces of general type.
The aim of this note is to study local and global Seshadri constants for a family of smooth surfaces with prescribed polarization. We shall first observe that given $\alpha$ being smaller than the square root of the degree of polarization, the set of local Seshadri constants in the range $(0, \alpha]$ is finite. This in particular implies that the square root of the degree of polarization is the only possible accumulation point of the set of local Seshadri constants. Next we shall remark the Zariski closedness of the set of points whose local Seshadri constants are in any given interval $(0, a]$. As applications, we shall also add a few remarks on the lower semi-continuity of both local and global Seshadri constants with respect to parameters involved, and on the minimality and the maximality of their infimum and supremum.
We show that for a polynomial map, the size of the Jordan blocks for the eigenvalue 1 of the monodromy at infinity is bounded by the multiplicity of the reduced divisor at infinity of a good compactification of a general fiber. The existence of such Jordan blocks is related to global invariant cycles of the graded pieces of the weight filtration. These imply some applications to period integrals. We also show that such a Jordan block of size greater than 1 for the graded pieces of the weight filtration is the restriction of a strictly larger Jordan block for the total cohomology group. If there are no singularities at infinity, we have a more precise statement on the monodromy.
We calculate Tits buildings for certain arithmetic subgroups of Sp(4). These give information about the boundary of the corresponding moduli spaces of abelian surfaces. More pictures (in colour) and a summary of the results (in English) can be found at http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masgks/Buildings/
We study the birational rigidity problem for smooth Mori fibrations on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 and 2. For degree 1 we obtain a complete description of rigid and non-rigid cases.
In 1932 F. Severi claimed, with an incorrect proof, that every smooth minimal projective surface $S$ such that the bundle $\Omega^1_S$ is generically generated by global sections satisfies the topological inequality $2c_1^2(S)\ge c_2(S)$. According to Enriques-Kodaira classification, the above inequality is easily verified when the Kodaira dimension of the surface is $\le 1$, while for surfaces of general type it is still an open problem known as Severi conjecture. In this paper we prove Severi conjecture under the additional mild hypothesis that $S$ has ample canonical bundle. Moreover, under the same assumption, we prove that $2c_1^2(S)=c_2(S)$ if and only if $S$ is a double cover of an abelian surface.
Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a local field. Let us say that a complex function on V is elementary if it is a product of the additive character of a rational function Q on V and multiplicative characters of polynomials on V.   In this paper we study when the Fourier transform of an elementary function is elementary. If Q has a nonzero Hessian, a necessary condition for this is that the Legendre transform Q_* of Q is rational. The basic example is a nondegenerate quadratic form. We study such functions Q, give examples, and find all of them such that both Q and Q_* are of the form f(x)/t, where f is a cubic form in many variables (the simplest case after quadratic forms). It turns out that this classification is closely related to Zak's classification of Severi varieties.   The second half of the paper is devoted to finding and classifying elementary functions with elementary Fourier transforms when Q is a fixed function with rational Q_*. We consider the simplest case when Q is a monomial, and classify combinations of multiplicative characters that can arise. The answer (for real and complex fields) is given in terms of exact covering systems. We also describe examples related to prehomogeneous vector spaces. Finally, we consider examples over p-adic fields, and in particular give a local proof of an integral formula of D.K. that could previously be proved only by a global method.
Let ${\rm F}$ be a rank-2 semi-stable sheaf on the projective plane, with Chern classes $c_{1}=0,c_{2}=n$. The curve $\beta_{\rm F}$ of jumping lines of ${\rm F}$, in the dual projective plane, has degree $n$. Let ${\rm M}_{n}$ be the moduli space of equivalence classes of semi-stables sheaves of rank 2 and Chern classes $(0,n)$ on the projective plane and ${\cal C}_{n}$ be the projective space of curves of degree $n$ in the dual projective plane. The Barth morphism $$\beta: {\rm M}_{n}\longrightarrow{\cal C}_{n}$$ associates the point $\beta_{\rm F}$ to the class of the sheaf ${\rm F}$. We prove that this morphism is generically injective for $n\geq 4.$ The image of $\beta$ is a closed subvariety of dimension $4n-3$ of ${\cal C}_{n}$; as a consequence of our result, the degree of this image is given by the Donaldson number of index $4n-3$ of the projective plane.
The article has two parts. The first part is devoted to proving a singular version of the logarithmic Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano vanishing theorem of Esnault and Viehweg. This is then used to prove other vanishing theorems. In the second part these vanishing theorems are used to prove an Arakelov-Parshin type boundedness result for families of canonically polarized varieties with rational Gorenstein singularities.
Let X be a nonsingular algebraic variety in characteristic zero. To an effective divisor on X Kontsevich has associated a certain 'motivic integral', living in a completion of the Grothendieck ring of algebraic varieties. He used this invariant to show that birational Calabi-Yau varieties have the same Hodge numbers. Then Denef and Loeser introduced the motivic (Igusa) zeta function, associated to a regular function on X, which specializes to both the classical p-adic Igusa zeta function and the topological zeta function, and also to Kontsevich's invariant.   This paper treats a generalization to singular varieties. Batyrev already considered such a 'Kontsevich invariant' for log terminal varieties (on the level of Hodge polynomials instead of in the Grothendieck ring), and previously we introduced a motivic zeta function on normal surface germs. Here on any Q-Gorenstein variety X we associate a motivic zeta function and a 'Kontsevich invariant' to effective Q-Cartier divisors on X whose support contains the singular locus of X.
Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro, and Vainshtein announced a remarkable formula expressing Hurwitz numbers (counting covers of the projective line with specified simple branch points, and specified branching over one other point) in terms of Hodge integrals. We give a proof of this formula using virtual localization on the moduli space of stable maps, and describe how the proof could be simplified by the proper algebro-geometric definition of a "relative space".
In this paper we give the projective generation of congruences of order 1 of r-dimensional projective spaces in P^N from their focal loci. In a natural way, this construction shows that the corresponding surfaces in the grassmannian are the Veronese surface, and rational ruled surfaces eventually with singularities. We characterize when these surfaces are smooth, recovering and generalizing a Ziv Ran's result.
This paper gives the all possible global indices of log Calabi-Yau 3-folds with standard coefficients on the boundaries and having lc, non-klt singularities. This follows easily from the discussion in the paper: The indices of log canonical singularities by Fujino (AG/9909035).
We study the following question: fix a sufficient general curve D of degree d in P^2, what is the least number of intersections between D and an irreducible curve of degree m? G. Xu proved this number i(d, m) is at least d - 2 for all m. This problem can be regarded as the algebraic part of Kobayashi conjecture on the hyperbolicity of P^2 D. We first improved Xu's bound with m fixed and then generalized his result to rational ruled surfaces.
Our main theorem characterizes the complete intersections of codimension 2 in a projective space of dimension 3 or more over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 as the subcanonical and self-linked subschemes. In order to prove this theorem, we'll prove the Gherardelli linkage theorem, which asserts that a partial intersection of two hypersurfaces is subcanonical if and only if its residual intersection is, scheme-theoretically, the intersection of the two hypersurfaces with a third.
We apply the homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curves to the study of indefinite theta series. We prove that every such series corresponding to a quadratic form of signature (1,1) can be expressed in terms of theta series associated with split quadratic forms and the usual theta series. We also show that indefinite theta series corresponding to univalued Massey products between line bundles on elliptic curve are modular.
Hyperquot schemes are generalizations of Grothendieck's Quot scheme to partial flags. Using a Bialynicki-Birula decomposition, we obtain combinatorial data for the Betti numbers, and collect this information into the form of rational generating functions for the Poincare polynomials.
The article starts with some introductory material about resolution graphs of normal surface singularities (definitions, topological/homological properties, etc). We then discuss the case when the normal surface singularity is an N-fold cyclic covering of a surface germ, branched along a curve given by the germ of an analytic function f. We present non-trivial examples in order to show that from the embedded resolution graph G of f in general it is not possible to recover the resolution graph of the cyclic covering. The main results are the construction of a ``universal covering graph'' from the topology of the germ f, and the completely combinatorial construction of the resolution graph of cyclic coverings from this universal graph of f and the integer N. For this we also prove some purely graph-theoretical classification theorems of ``covering graphs''. In the last part, we connect the properties of the universal covering graph with the topological invariants of f, e.g. with the nilpotent part of its algebraic monodromy.
In this article we give a construction of the resolution graphs of hypersurface surface singularities (X_k,0) given by generalized Iomdin series. All these resolution graphs are coordinated by an ``universal bi-colored graph'' which is associated with the ICIS determining the Iomdin series. The definition of this new graph is rather involved, and in concrete examples it is difficult to compute. Nevertheless, we present a large number of examples. This is very helpful in the exemplification of its properties as well. We then present a construction of the resolution graphs of the surface singularities above which uses the "universal bi-coloured graph" and the integer k. This is formulated in a purely combinatorial algorithm. The result is a highly non-trivial generalization of the case of cyclic coverings of smooth surfaces.
This paper has been withdrawn due to a crucial error in the proof of the main theorem
We prove relations among the classes of certain divisors on the moduli spaces of curves with marked points, generalizing the Brill-Noether Ray Theorem of Eisenbud and Harris.
In this paper we prove the Tamagawa number conjecture of Bloch and Kato for CM elliptic curves using a new explicit description of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm. The Tamagawa number conjecture describes the special values of the L-function of a CM elliptic curve in terms of the regulator maps of the K-theory of the variety into Deligne and etale cohomology. The regulator map to Deligne cohomology was computed by Deninger with the help of the Eisenstein symbol. For the Tamagawa number conjecture one needs an understanding of the $p$-adic regulator on the subspace of K-theory defined by the Eisenstein symbol. This is accomplished by giving a new explicit computation of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf. It turns out that this sheaf is an inverse limit of $p^r$-torsion points of a certain one-motive. The cohomology classes of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf can then be described by classes of sections of certain line bundles. These sections are elliptic units and going carefully through the construction one finds an analog of the elliptic Soul\'e elements. Finally Rubin's ``main conjecture'' of Iwasawa theory is used to compare these elements with etale cohomology.
Let $X$ be a smooth hypersurface of degree $n\geq 3$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$. We prove that the log canonical threshold of $H\in|-K_X|$ is at least $\frac{n-1}{n}$. Under the assumption of the Log minimal model program, we also prove that a hyperplane section $H$ of $X$ is a cone in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ over a smooth hypersurface of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-2}$ if and only if the log canonical threshold of $H$ is $\frac{n-1}{n}$.
The mirror theorem is generalized to any smooth projective variety X. That is, a fundamental relation between the Gromov-Witten invariants of X and Gromov-Witten invariants of complete intersections Y in X is established.
This is the text of a Bourbaki lecture that I gave on March 12, 2000.
Let U be an open subset of a unirational variety. We prove that there is rational curve C in U such that the fundamental group of C surjects onto the fundamental group of U. As a consequence we obtain new proofs of the theorems of Harbater and Colliot-Th\'el\`ene on Galois covers and torsors over the p-adic line. We also obtain examples of pencils of curves of genus <14 whose monodromy group is the full Teichm\"uller group.
Let us consider the rank 14 lattice $P=D_4^3\oplus < -2> \oplus < 2>$. We define a K3 surface S of type P with the property that $P\subset {\rm Pic}(S) $, where ${\rm Pic}(S) $ indicates the Picard lattice of S. In this article we study the family of K3 surfaces of type P with a certain fixed multipolarization. We note the orthogonal complement of P in the K3 lattice takes the form $$ U(2)\oplus U(2)\oplus (-2I_4). $$ We show the following results: \item{(1)}   A K3 surface of type P has a representation as a double cover over ${\bf P}^1\times {\bf P}^1$ as the following affine form in (s,t,w) space: $$ S=S(x): w^2=\prod_{k=1}^4 (x_{1}^{(k)}st+x_{2}^{(k)}s+x_{3}^{(k)}t+x_{4}^{(k)}), \ x_k=\pmatrix{x_{1}^{(k)}&x_{2}^{(k)}\cr x_{3}^{(k)}&x_{4}^{(k)}} \in M(2,{\bf C}). $$ We make explicit description of the Picard lattice and the transcendental lattice of S(x). \item{(2)}   We describe the period domain for our family of marked K3 surfaces and determine the modular group. \par \noindent \item{(3)}   We describe the differential equation for the period integral of S(x) as a function of $x\in (GL(2,{\bf C}))^4$. That bocomes to be a certain kind of hypergeometric one. We determine the rank, the singular locus and the monodromy group for it. \par \noindent \item{(4)} It appears a family of 8 dimensional abelian varieties as the family of Kuga-Satake varieties for our K3 surfaces. The abelian variety is characterized by the property that the endomorphism algebra contains the Hamilton quarternion field over ${\bf Q}$.
Let R be a Dedekind scheme, $\nu$ its generic point, X and V del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 over R that are Gorenstein Mori fiber spaces (as 3-folds germs over the ground field). We study birational maps $\phi:X\dasharrow V$ over R which are isomorphisms over the generic point of R. We put down normal forms of such transformations (in suitable coordinates) and give some properties of X and V. In particular, we prove the uniqueness of a smooth model.
A K-theoretic counterpart of quantum cohomology theory is discussed.
In this paper we define an action of the Weyl group on the quiver varieties $M_{m,\grl}(d,v)$ with generic $(m,\grl)$. To do it we describe a set of generators of the projective ring of a quiver variety. We also prove connectness for the smooth quiver variety $M(d,v)$ and normality for $M_0(d,v)$ in the case of a quiver of finite type and $d-v$ a regular weight.
We prove the connectedness of the moduli space of maps (of fixed genus and homology class) to the homogeneous space G/P by degeneration via the maximal torus action. In the genus 0 case, the irreducibility of the moduli of maps is a direct consequence of connectedness. An analysis of a related Bialynicki-Birula stratification of the map space yields a rationality result: the (coarse) moduli space of genus 0 maps to G/P is a rational variety. The rationality argument depends essentially upon rationality results for quotients of SL2 representations proven by Katsylo and Bogomolov.
Let $X$ be a complete normal variety, $B$ an effective $\mathbb{R}$-divisor on $X$, and $D$ a Cartier divisor on $X$. Assume that the pair $(X, B)$ is log terminal. We consider the problem whether $H^0(X, D) \ne 0$ and obtain some results in lower dimensions.
Results of our previous note, "Gerbes of chiral differential operators" (Math. Res. Letters, 7(2000), 55-66), are discussed in the algebraic category.
Suppose X is a smooth projective 3-fold of general type and |mK_X| is composed of a pencil of surfaces with m>1. This pencil naturally induces a fibration f:X->C onto a smooth curve C after the Stein-factorization, which is the main objects of this article. Based on Koll'ar's earlier works, we improve on it and try to understand the family in terms of discrete birational invariants of the total space as well as those of the general fiber and the base curve. The aim of this note is to build a little bit basic facts.
Some new results on plane F_{q^2}-maximal curves are stated and proved. It is known that the degree d of such curves is upper bounded by q+1 and that d=q+1 if and only if the curve is F_{q^2}-isomorphic to the Hermitian. We show that d\le q+1 can be improved to d\le (q+2)/2 apart from the case d=q+1 or q\le 5. This upper bound turns out to be sharp for q odd. We also study the maximality of Hurwitz curves of degree n+1. We show that they are F_{q^2}-maximal if and only if (q+1) divides (n^2-n+1). Such a criterion is extended to a wider family of curves.
We show that the set of F_q-rational points of either certain Fermat curves or certain F_q-Frobenius non-classical plane curves is a complete (k,d)-arc in P^2(F_q), where k and d are respectively the number of F_q-rational points and the degree of the underlying curve.
In this paper we prove that Arnold Surfaces of all real algebraic curves of even degree with non-empty real part are standard (Rokhlin's Conjecture). There is an obvious connection with classification of Arnold Surfaces up to isotopy of S^4 and Hilbert's Sixteen Problem on the arrangements of connected real components of curves. First, we consider some M-curves, i.e curves of a prescribed degree having the greatest possible number of connected real components, and prove that Arnold surfaces of these curves are standard. Afterwards, we exhibit a procedure of modification "perestroika" of these M-curves which allows to prove the Rokhlin's Conjecture.
In the 80's D. Eisenbud and J. Harris posed the following question: "What are the limits of Weierstrass points in families of curves degenerating to stable curves not of compact type?" We answer their question for one-dimensional families of smooth curves degenerating to stable curves with just two components meeting at points in general position. In this note we treat only those families whose total space is regular. Nevertheless, we announce here our most general answer, to be presented in detail in a forthcoming submission.
In 70's there was discovered a construction how to attach to some algebraic-geometric data an infinite-dimensional subspace in the space k((z)) of the Laurent power series. Now this construction is called the Krichever map. In e-print math.AG/9911097 A.N. Parshin suggested a generalization of the Krichever map for the case of algebraic surfaces from the point of view of 2-dimensional local fields.   In this work we suggest a generalization of the Krichever map to the case of algebraic varieties of arbitrary dimension from the point of view of multidimensional local fields. For surfaces our construction coincides with the Parshin construction.   Besides, we obtain new explicit acyclic resolutions of quasicoherent sheaves connected with multidimensional local fields.
We prove the arithmetic Hodge index and hard Lefschetz conjectures for the Grassmannian $G=G(2,N)$ parametrizing lines in projective space, for the natural arithmetic Lefschetz operator defined via the Pl\"ucker embedding of $G$ in projective space. The analysis of the Hodge index inequalities involves estimates on certain Racah polynomials.
In this article we prove the irreducibility of the Hilbert scheme of rationnal curves on homogeneous varieties with fixed class in the Chow ring. This result has also been proved by J. F. Thomsen [T] and B. Kim and R. Pandharipande [KP]. Our method is totaly different (we don't use the compactification of stable maps) and enables us to prove the existence of rational smooth curves on homogeneous varities with fixed class in the Chow ring. This was not the case of Thomsen's and Kim and Pandharipande's proofs. We use a decomposition of G/P in orbits (called the P'-orbits, see definition) which are bigger than the Schubert cells. We then prove that these P'-orbits are "towers" of affine bundles (see definition) over "smaller" homogeneous varities. This description gives the results. Our decomposition in P'-orbits enables us to give a "better" desingularisation of Schubert varities than Demazure's one.
In their article [1], L. Gruson and M. Skiti have constructed a birationnal map from the variety $\I$ of mathematical instantons of degree 3 to the variety of nets of quadrics in $\pd$. They describe by this way two irreducible componants of the boundary of $\I$ associated to the divisor of nets which contain a two-plane degenerated quadric and the divisor of L\" uroth nets. In this article we describe an irreducible componante of the boundary of $\I$ as the exceptionnal divisor of the blowing-up of the closed set of nets of quadrics of rank 3.
We consider subtorus actions on complex toric varieties. A natural candidate for a categorical quotient of such an action is the so-called toric quotient, a universal object constructed in the toric category. We prove that if the toric quotient is weakly proper and if in addition the quotient variety is of expected dimension then the toric quotient is in fact a categorical quotient in the category of algebraic varieties. For example, weak properness always holds for the toric quotient of a subtorus action on a toric variety whose fan has a convex support.
A classification theorem is given of projective threefolds that are covered by a two-dimensional family of lines, but not by a higher dimensional family.
An explicit upper bound for the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces is obtained, using Penner's combinatorial integration scheme with embedded trivalent graphs. It is shown that for a fixed number of punctures n and for genus g going to infinity, the Weil-Petersson volume of M_{g,n} has an upper bound c^g g^{2g}. Here c is an independent of n constant, which is given explicitly.
We prove that a smooth projective variety of dimension n is isomorphic to projective n-space iff the canonical class is -(n+1)-times an ample divisor. In characteristic zero this was proved by Kobayashi-Ochiai. We also extend the second adjunction theorem of Ionescu and Fujita to arbitrary characteristic.
In this note we calculate the multiplier ideal associated to an arbitrary monomial ideal in C^n. We discuss applications to the calculation of log canonical thresholds.
A fundamental goal of algebraic geometry is to do for singular varieties whatever we can do for smooth ones. Intersection homology, for example, directly produces groups associated to any variety which have almost all the properties of the usual homology groups of a smooth variety. Minimal model theory suggests the possibility of working more indirectly by relating any singular variety to a variety which is smooth or nearly so.   Here we use ideas from minimal model theory to define some characteristic numbers for singular varieties, generalizing the Chern numbers of a smooth variety. This was suggested by Goresky and MacPherson as a next natural problem after the definition of intersection homology. We find that only a subspace of the Chern numbers can be defined for singular varieties. A convenient way to describe this subspace is to say that a smooth variety has a fundamental class in complex bordism, whereas a singular variety can at most have a fundamental class in a weaker homology theory, elliptic homology. We use this idea to give an algebro-geometric definition of elliptic homology: ``complex bordism modulo flops equals elliptic homology.''
The main goal of this paper is to study varieties with the best possible Mori theoretic properties (measured by the existence of a certain decomposition of the cone of effective divisors). We call such a variety a Mori Dream Space. There turn out to be many examples, including quasi-smooth projective toric (or more generally, spherical) varieties, many GIT quotients, and log Fano 3-folds. We characterize Mori dream spaces as GIT quotients of affine varieties by a torus in a manner generalizing Cox's construction of toric varieties as quotients of affine space. Via the quotient description, the chamber decomposition of the cone of divisors in Mori theory is naturally identified with the decomposition of the G-ample cone from geometric invariant theory. In particular every rational contraction of a Mori dream space comes from GIT, and all possible factorizations of a rational contraction can be read off from the chamber decomposition.
Let X be a projective variety which is covered by a family of rational curves of minimal degree. The classic bend-and-break argument of Mori asserts that if x and y are two general points, then there are at most finitely many curves in that family which contain both x and y. In this work we shed some light on the question as to whether two sufficiently general points actually define a unique curve.   As an immediate corollary to the results of this paper, we give a characterization of projective spaces which improves on the known generalizations of Kobayashi-Ochiai's theorem.
In this article we give a general approach to the following analogue of Shafarevich's conjecture for some polarized algebraic varieties; suppose that we fix a type of an algebraic variety and look at families of such type of varieties over a fixed Riemann surface with fixed points over which we have singular varieties, then one can ask if the set of such families, up to isomorphism, is finite.   In this paper we give a general approach to such types of problems. The main observation is the following; suppose that the moduli space of a fixed type of algebraic polarized variety exists and suppose that in some projective smooth compactification of the coarse moduli the discriminant divisor supports an ample one, then it is not difficult to see that this fact implies the analogue of Shafarevich's conjecture.   In this article we apply this method to certain polarized algebraic K3 surfaces and also to Enriques surfaces.
In this paper we generalized the variational formulas for the determinants of the Laplacians on functions of CY metrics to forms of type (0,q) on CY manifolds. We also computed the Ray Singer Analytic torsion on CY manifolds we proved that it is bounded by a constant. In case of even dimensional CY manifolds the Ray Singer Analytic torsion is zero. The interesting case is the odd dimensional one.
In this paper we construct the analogue of Dedekind eta function for odd dimensional CY manifolds. We use the theory of determinant line bundles. We constructed a canonical holomorphic section $\eta^{N}$ of some power of the determinant line bundle on the moduli space of odd dimensional CY manifolds.   According to Viehweg the moduli space of moduli space of polarized odd dimensional CY manifolds $\mathcal{M}(M)$ is quasi projective. According to a Theorem due to Hironaka we can find a projective smooth variety $\bar {\mathcal{M}(M)}$ such that $\bar{\mathcal{M}(M)}\backslash$ $\mathcal{M}(M)=\mathcal{D}_{\infty}$ is a divisor of normal crossings. We also showed by using Mumford's theory of metrics with logarithmic growths that the determinant line bundle can be canonically prolonged to $\bar {\mathcal{M}(M)}$ $.$ We also showed that there exists section $\eta$ of some power of the determinant line bundle which vanishes on $\mathcal{D}_{\infty}$ and has a Quillen norm the Ray Singer Analytic Torsion$.$ This section is that analogue of the Dedekind eta Function $\eta.$
Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a 4-dimensional log variety which is proper over the field of complex numbers and with only divisorial log terminal singularities. The log canonical divisor $K_X+\Delta$ is semi-ample, if it is nef (numerically effective) and the Iitaka dimension $\kappa(X,K_X+\Delta)$ is strictly positive. For the proof, we use Fujino's abundance theorem for semi log canonical threefolds.
The goal of this note is to exhibit the integrability properties (in the sense of the Frobenius theorem) of holomorphic p-forms with values in certain line bundles with seminegative curvature on a compact Kaehler manifold. There are in fact very strong restrictions, both on the holomorphic form and on the curvature of the seminegative line bundle. As a consequence, these observations provide interesting information on the structure of projective manifolds which admit a contact structure: either they are Fano manifolds or, thanks to results of Kebekus-Peternell-Sommese-Wisniewski, they are biholomorphic to the projectivization of the cotangent bundle of another suitable projective manifold.
We compute the dimensions of spaces of sections of all powers of the Donaldson determinant bundle on the moduli space of rank 2 semi-stable sheaves on the projective plane, with zero first Chern class, and second Chern class equal to 3 or 4. We prove Le Potier's strange duality conjecture in some cases.
Let X be a projective 3-fold with at most Q-factorial terminal singularities on which K_X is nef and big. Suppose the canonical index r(X)>1. For any positive integer m, it is interesting to consider the base point freeness and birationality of the divisor mK_X. For example, we know the following results:   (1) the system |5rK_X| is base point free (Ein-Lazarsfeld-Lee);   (2) |mK_X| gives a birational map for all m>4r+2 (M. Hanamura).   This article aims to present a better result in direction (2). As far as our method can tell here, |mK_X| gives a birational map for all m>2r+5. (Q-divisor method + patient calculation)
We prove a few uniform versions of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture and of the Shafarevich Conjecture for curves over function fields and their rational points. The main focus is on function fields having high transcendence degree over the complex numbers.
We give an explicit formula for the determinant of the Gau{\ss}-Manin connection for an irregular connection on a Zariski open set of the projective line $\P^1_K$ over a function field $K$ over a field $k$ of characteristic zero.
We show birationality of the morphism associated to line bundles $L$ of type $(1,...,1,2,...,2,4,...,4)$ on a generic $g-$dimensional abelian variety into its complete linear system such that $h^0(L)=2^g$. When $g=3$, we describe the image of the abelian threefold and from the geometry of the moduli space $SU_C(2)$ in the linear system $|2\theta_C|$, we obtain analogous results in $\p H^0(L)$.
This article is an extended version of preprint math.AG/9902104. We find an explicit formula for the number of topologically different ramified coverings of a sphere by a genus g surface with only one complicated branching point in terms of Hodge integrals over the moduli space of genus g curves with marked points.
We give the multiplicity of terminal singularities on threefolds by simple calculation. Then we obtain the best inequalities for the multiplicity and the index. By using this, we can improve the boundedness number of terminal weak Q-Fano 3-folds in [KMMT, Theorem 1.2]. Furthermore, we can extended [K, Theorem 3.6] for Fujita freeness conditions to nonhypersurface terminal singularities.
We describe the quantum cohomology rings of a class of toric varieties. The description includes, in addition to the (already known) ring presentations, the (new) analogues for toric varieties of the sorts of quantum Giambelli formulas which exist already for Grassmannian varieties, flag varieties, etc.
We show that polarisations of type (1,...,1,2g+2) on g-dimensional abelian varieties are $\it{never}$ very ample, if $g\geq 3$. This disproves a conjecture of Debarre, Hulek and Spandaw. We also give a criterion for non-embeddings of abelian varieties into 2g+1-dimensional linear systems.
We proved the factorization of generalized theta functions when the curve has two irreducible components meeting at one node.
In this article, we show that very ample line bundles of type (1,1,d) on an abelian threefold A, with NS(A)\simeq \ze, give projectively normal embeddings, if d=22,26 or when d\geq 28.
For a linear system $|C|$ on a smooth projective surface $S$, whose general element is a smooth, irreducible curve, the Severi variety $V_{|C|, \delta}$ is the locally closed subscheme of $|C|$ which parametrizes irreducible curves with only $\delta$ nodes as singularities. In this paper we give numerical conditions on the class of divisors and upper-bounds on $\delta$ ensuring that the corresponding Severi variety is everywhere smooth of codimension $\delta$ in $|C|$ (regular, for short). In particular, we focus on surfaces of general type, since for such surfaces less is known than what is proven for other cases. Our result generalizes some results of Chiantini-Sernesi (1997) and of Greuel-Lossen-Shustin (1997 - in the case of nodes) as it is shown by some examples of Severi varieties on blown-up surfaces or surfaces in $\P^3$ which are elements of a component of the Noether-Lefschetz locus. We also consider examples of regular Severi varieties on surfaces in $\P^3$ of general type which contain a line.
The survey gives an overview of the achievements in topology of real algebraic varieties in the direction initiated in the early 70th by V.I.Arnold and V.A.Rokhlin. We make an attempt to systematize the principal results in the subject. After an exposition of general tools and results, special attention is paid to surfaces and curves on surfaces.
We prove the Aspinwall-Morrison formula by relating their calculation to Gromov-Witten theory.
We prove that there exists a positive number $C_{n}$ depending only on $n$ such that for every smooth projective $n$-fold of general type $X$ defined over {\bf C}, the automorphism group $Aut(X)$ satisfies the inequality $\sharp{Aut}(X)\leq C_{n}\cdot\mu (X,K_{X})$, where $\mu (X,K_{X})$ is the volume of $X$ with respect to $K_{X}$.
We investigate how the chain property for the associated primes of monomial degenerations of toric (or lattice) ideals can be generalized to arbitrary A-graded ideals. The generalization works in dimension d=2, but it fails for d>2.
We show that any birational map between projective hyperK\"ahler manifolds of dimension 4 is composed of a sequence of simple flops or elementary Mukai transformations under the assumption that each irreducible component of the indeterminacy of the birational map is normal.
Let $X\subset Y$ be smooth, projective manifolds. Assume that $X$ is the zero locus of a generic section of a direct sum $V+$ of positive line bundles on $\PP^n$. Furthermore assume that the normal bundle $N_{X/Y}$ is a direct sum $V-$ of negative line bundles. We show that a $V:=V+\oplus V-$-twisted Gromov-Witten theory of $\PP^n$ restricts to the Gromov-Witten theory of $X$ inherited form $Y$. The later one can be computed via a Mirror Theorem which we prove in this paper.
The main result of this paper is that every (separated) toric variety which has a semigroup structure compatible with multiplication on the underlying torus is necessarily affine. In the course of proving this statement, we also give a proof of the fact that every separated toric variety may be constructed from a certain fan in a Euclidean space. To our best knowledge, this proof differs essentially from the ones which can be found in the literature.
We study Mirror Symmetry of log Calabi-Yau surfaces. On one hand, we consider the number of ``affine lines'' of each degree in the complement of a smooth cubic in the projective plane. On the other hand, we consider coefficients of a certain expansion of a function obtained from the integrals of dxdy/xy over 2-chains whose boundaries lie on B_\phi where {B_\phi} is a family of smooth cubics. Then, for small degrees, they coincide.   We discuss the relation between this phenomenon and local mirror symmetry for projective plane in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold by Chiang-Klemm-Yau-Zaslow.
We study the deformations of a holomorphic symplectic manifold $M$, not necessarily compact, over a formal ring. We show (under some additional, but mild, assumptions on $M$) that the coarse deformation space exists and is smooth, finite-dimensional and naturally embedded into $H^2(M)$. For a holomorphic symplectic manifold $M$ which satisfies $H^1(M,{\cal O}_M) = H^2(M,{\cal O}_M)=0$, the coarse moduli of formal deformations is isomorphic to $\Spec\C[[t_1, ..., t_n]]$, where $t_1$, ... $t_n$ are coordinates in $H^2(M)$.   This revised version contains one minor improvement: exposition in Subsection 5.1 has been made more detailed and rigourous.
Let M_g be the moduli space of smooth curves of genus g >= 3, and \bar{M}_g the Deligne-Mumford compactification in terms of stable curves. Let \bar{M}_g^{[1]} be an open set of \bar{M}_g consisting of stable curves of genus g with one node at most. In this paper, we determine the necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that a Q-divisor D on \bar{M}_g is nef over \bar{M}_g^{[1]}, that is, (D . C) >= 0 for all irreducible curves C on \bar{M}_g with C \cap \bar{M}_g^{[1]} \not= \emptyset.
Let X be a smooth cubic threefold, M the moduli space of stable rank 2 vector bundles on X with trivial determinant and c_2=2 (the smallest value for which this space is non-empty). Recent results of Druel, Iliev, Markushevich and Tikhomirov lead to a precise description of M and its Maruyama compactification M': the latter is isomorphic to the intermediate Jacobian of X blown-up along the Fano surface. In this survey paper we explain these results and discuss some applications.
It was proved by Ginzburg and Mirkovic-Vilonen that the $G(O)$-equivariant perverse sheaves on the affine grassmannian of a connected reductive group $G$ form a tensor category equivalent to the tensor category of finite dimensional representations of the dual group $G^\vee$. The proof use the Tannakian formalism. The purpose of this paper is to construct explicitely the action of $G^\vee$ on the global cohomology of a perverse sheaf.
We prove a conjecture of Frenkel, Gaitsgory, Kazhdan and Vilonen, related to Fourier coefficients of spherical perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian associated to a a split reductive group. Our proof is an extension of the proof given by the first author in the case of GL(n) (see math/9801109); it relies on the study of certain resolutions of Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannian, built from the so-called minuscule or quasi-minuscule cases.
Let G be a semi-simple algebraic group over ${\mathbb C}$, B a Borel subgroup of G and T a maximal torus in B. A beautiful unpublished result of Dale Peterson says that if G is simply laced, then every rationally smooth point of a Schubert variety X in G/B is nonsingular in X. The purpose of this paper is to generalize this result to arbitrary T-stable subvarieties of G/B, the only restriction being that G contains no $G_2$ factors. In particular, we show that a Schubert variety X in such a G/B is nonsingular if and only if all the reduced tangent cones of X are linear.
In this paper we prove that any smooth prime Fano threefold, different from the Mukai-Umemura threefold, contains a 1-dimensional family of intersecting lines. Combined with a result of the second author (see J. Algebr. Geom. 8:2 (1999), 221-244) this implies that any morphism from a smooth Fano threefold of index 2 to a smooth Fano threefold of index 1 must be constant, which gives an answer in dimension 3 to a question stated by Peternell.
Let $S_0$ be a smooth and compact real variety given by a reduced regular sequence of polynomials $f_1, ..., f_p$. This paper is devoted to the algorithmic problem of finding {\em efficiently} a representative point for each connected component of $S_0$ . For this purpose we exhibit explicit polynomial equations that describe the generic polar varieties of $S_0$. This leads to a procedure which solves our algorithmic problem in time that is polynomial in the (extrinsic) description length of the input equations $f_1, >..., f_p$ and in a suitably introduced, intrinsic geometric parameter, called the {\em degree} of the real interpretation of the given equation system $f_1, >..., f_p$.
Let $X$ be an ordinary smooth curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. The absolute Frobenius induces a rational map $F$ on the moduli space $M_X$ of rank 2 vector bundles with fixed trivial determinant. If the genus of $X$ is 2, the moduli space $M_X$ is isomorphic to projective space of dimension 3 (as over the complex numbers). In this case we explicitly give the equations of $F$, which enables us to determine, for example, its base locus (one point) and its image (different from $M_X$).
In this paper we address the following question arising from the work of P. Etingof, D. Kazhdan and A. Polishchuk (math.AG/0003009): given a homogeneous complex polynomial, when the rational map defined by its partials is of degree 1? We answer this question for reduced polynomials in three variables and also for reduced polynomials in four variables which factor into the product of linear polynomials.
On an affine variety $X$ defined by homogeneous polynomials, every line in the tangent cone of $X$ is a subvariety of $X$. However there are many other germs of analytic varieties which are not of cone type but contain ``lines'' passing through the origin. In this paper, we give a method to determine the existence and the ``number'' of such lines on non-degenerate surface singualrities.
Working in characteristic two, I classify nonsmooth Enriques surfaces with normal crossing singularities. Using Kato's theory of logarithmic structures, I show that such surfaces are smoothable and lift to characteristic zero, provided they are d-semistable.
Among solutions of n-Gelfand-Dikii's hierarchy there exists a remarkable solution W, which satisfies the string equation. We call it Witten's solution because according to the Witten conjecture the function F(x_1, x_2, x_3,...) = W(x_1,(x_2)/2, (x_3)/3,...) is the generating function for intersection nambers of Mumford-Morita-Muller cohomological classes of the moduli space of n-spin Riemann surfaces. This conjecture was proved by Kontsevich for n=2 and by Witten himself for surfaces of genus 0.   In this paper we find recurrence relations between coefficients of Taylor series of W. This reduces the Witten's conjecture to conjecture that the Mamford-Morita-Muller numbers satisfy to the same relations. These relations give also an algorithm for calculation of $n$-spin Mamford-Morita-Muller numbers in assuming that the Witten conjecture is true. Moreover we prove that F(x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1},0,0,...)= W(x_1, (x_2)/2,...,(x_{n-1})/(n-1),0,0,...).
We give canonical resolutions of singularities of several cone varieties arising from invariant theory. We establish a connection between our resolutions and resolutions of singularities of closure of conjugacy classes in classical Lie algebras.
Generalizing cones over projective toric varieties, we present arbitrary toric varieties as quotients of quasiaffine toric varieties. Such quotient presentations correspond to groups of Weil divisors generating the topology. Groups comprising Cartier divisors define free quotients, whereas $\QQ$-Cartier divisors define geometric quotients. Each quotient presentation yields homogeneous coordinates. Using homogeneous coordinates, we express quasicoherent sheaves in terms of multigraded modules and describe the set of morphisms into a toric variety.
We prove the following version of Wlodarczyk's Embedding Theorem: Every normal complex algebraic ${\bf C}^*$-variety admits an equivariant closed embedding into a toric prevariety $X$ on which ${\bf C}^*$ acts as a one-parameter-subgroup of the big torus of $X$.
We characterize embeddability of algebraic varieties into smooth toric varieties and prevarieties. Our embedding results hold also in an equivariant context and thus generalize a well known embedding theorem of Sumihiro on quasiprojective G-varieties. The main idea is to reduce the embedding problem to the affine case. This is done by constructing equivariant affine conoids, a tool which extends the concept of an equivariant affine cone over a projective G-variety to a more general framework.
We study the asymptotics of the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli spaces of compact Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures, for fixed $n$ as $g \to \infty$.
Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g bigger then 2. For any vector bundle E on X let M_k(E) be the scheme of all rank k subbundles of E with maximal degree. For every integers r, k and x with 0<k<r, x positive and either x less then (k-1)(r-2k+1) (if 2k is less then r) or (r-k-1)(2k-r+1) (if 2k> r), we construct a rank r stable vector bundle E such that M_k(E) has an irreducible component of dimension x. Furthermore, if there exists a stable vector bundle F with small Lange's invariant s_k(F) and with M_k(F) `spread enough', then X i s a multiple covering of a curve of genus bigger then 2.
We give a characterization of connected solvable groups in terms of the existence of representations with certain geometric properties. The existence of such representations for the group of upper triangular matrices played an important role in the proof of the authors' equivariant Riemann-Roch theorem.
In this paper we study the reduction of Galois covers of curves, from characteristic 0 to characteristic p. The starting point is a is a recent result of Raynaud which gives a criterion for good reduction for covers of the projective line branch at 3 points. Under some condition on the Galois group, we extend this criterion to the case of 4 branch points. Moreover, we describe the reduction of the Hurwitz space of such covers and compute the number of covers with good reduction.
We give a complete description of the tautological subgroup of the fourth cohomology group of the moduli space of pointed stable curves, and prove that for g \geq 8 it coincides with the cohomology group itself. We further give a conjectural upper bound depending on the genus for the degree of new tautological relations.
The purpose of this work is to describe the (category of) Higgs bundles on a complex scheme X having a given cameral cover X~. We show that this category is a T_{X~}-gerbe, where T_{X~} is a certain sheaf of abelian groups on X, and we describe the class of this gerbe precisely. In particular, it follows that the set of isomorphism classes of Higgs bundles with a fixed cameral cover X~ is a torsor over the group H^1(X, T_{X~}), which itself parametrizes T_{X~}-torsors on X. This underlying group can be described as a generalized Prym variety, whose connected component is either an abelian variety or a degeneration thereof.
Homology with values in a connection with possibly irregular singular points on an algebraic curve is defined, generalizing homology with values in the underlying local system for a connection with regular singular points. Integration defines a perfect pairing between de Rham cohomology with values in the connection and homology with values in the dual connection.
The paper consists of two sections. The first section provides a new definition of mirror symmetry of abelian varieties making sense also over $p$-adic fields. The second section introduces and studies quantized theta-functions with two-sided multipliers, which are functions on non-commutative tori. This is an extension of an earlier work by the author. In the Introduction and in the Appendix the constructions of this paper are put into a wider context.
This talk is dedicated to various aspects of Mirror Symmetry. It summarizes some of the mathematical developments that took place since M. Kontsevich's report at the Z\"urich ICM and provides an extensive, although not exhaustive, bibliography.
Segre proved that a smooth cubic surface over Q is unirational iff it has a rational point. We prove that the result also holds for cubic hypersurfaces over any field, including finite fields.
This paper contains a complete proof of a fundamental theorem on the normalizers of unipotent subgroups in semisimple algebraic groups.
We construct the derived version of the Hilbert scheme parametrizing subschemes in a given projective scheme X with given Hilbert polynomial h. This is a dg-manifold (smooth dg-scheme) RHilb_h(X) which carries a natural family of commutative (up to homotopy) dg-algebras, which over the usual Hilbert scheme is just given by truncations of the homogeneous coordinate rings of subschemes in X. In particular, RHilb_h(X) differs from RQuot_h(O_X), the derived Quot scheme constructed in our previous paper (math.AG/9905174) which carries only a family of A-infinity modules over the coordinate algebra of X.   As an application, we construct the derived version of the moduli stack of stable maps of (variable) algebraic curves to a given projective variety Y, thus realizing the original suggestion of M. Kontsevich.
On logarithmic paper some real algebraic curves look like smoothed broken lines. Moreover, the broken lines can be obtained as limits of those curves. The corresponding deformation can be viewed as a quantization, in which the broken line is a classical object and the curves are quantum. This generalizes to a new connection between algebraic geometry and the geometry of polyhedra, which is more straight-forward than the other known connections and gives a new insight into constructions used in the topology of real algebraic varieties.
We construct some natural cycles with trivial regulator in the higher Chow groups of Jacobians. For hyperelliptic curves we use a criterion due to J. Lewis to prove that the cycles we construct are indecomposable, and then use a specialization argument to prove indecomposability for more general curves.   Please note that math.AG/9909062 has become an obsolete version of some of the results in the present paper.
We study the degeneracy loci of general bundle morphisms from the direct sum of m copies of the structural sheaf on $P^n$ to $\Omega(2)$, also from the point of view of the classical geometrical interpretation of the sections of $\Omega(2)$ as linear line complexes. We consider in particular the case of $P^5$ with m=2, 3. For n=5 and m=3 we give an explicit description of the Hilbert scheme H of elliptic normal scrolls in $P^5$, by defining a natural rational map from the Grassmannian G(2,14) to H, which results to be dominant with general fibre of degree four.
Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective algebraic variety of maximal Albanese dimension. We give a characterization of $\kappa (X)$ in terms of the set $V^0(X,\omega_{X})$ $:=\{P\in {\text{\rm Pic}}^0(X)|h^0(X, \omega_X \otimes P) \ne 0\}$. An immediate consequence of this is that the Kodaira dimension $\kappa (X)$ is invariant under smooth deformations. We then study the pluricanonical maps $\phi_m:X -> \Bbb{P} (H^0(X,mK_X))$. We prove that if $X$ is of general type, $\phi_m$ is generically finite for $m\geq 5$ and birational for $m\geq 5 \text{\rm dim} (X) +1$. More generally, we show that for $m\geq 6$ the image of $\phi_m$ is of dimension equal to $\kappa (X)$ and for $m\geq 6\kappa (X)+2$, $\phi_m$ is the stable canonical map.
This note is a sequel to "Gerbes of chiral differential operators. II", math.AG/0003170. We study gerbes of chiral differential operators acting on the exterior algebra $\Lambda E$ of a vector bundle over a smooth algebraic variety $X$. When $E=\Omega^1_X$ this gerbe admits a canonical global section which coincides with the chiral de Rham complex of $X$.
For an irreducible projective variety X, we study the family of h-planes contained in the secant variety Sec_k(X), for 0<h<k. These families have an expected dimension and we study varieties for which the expected dimension is not attained; for these varieties, making general consecutive projections to lower dimensional spaces, we do not get the expected singularities. In particular, we examine the family G of lines sitting in 3-secant planes to a surface S. We show that the actual dimension of G is equal to the expected dimension unless S is a cone or a rational normal scroll of degree 4 in P^5.
We deal with a divisorial contraction in dimension 3 which contracts its exceptional divisor to a smooth point. We prove that any such contraction can be obtained by a suitable weighted blow-up.
We construct a geometric version of BRST cohomology complex of a chiral module over a Lie-* algebra using the language of differential graded Lie algebroids in the category of D-modules on a compact curve $X$.
A scheme of computing $\chi(\mbar_{1,n}, L_1^{\otimes d_1}\otimes ... \otimes L_n^{\otimes d_n})$ is given. Here $\mbar_{1,n}$ is the moduli space of $n$-pointed stable curves of genus one and $L_i$ are the universal cotangent line bundles defined by $x_i^*(\omega_{C/M})$, where $C \to \mbar_{1,n}$ is the universal curve, $\omega_{C/M}$ the relative dualizing sheaf and $x_i$ the marked point. This work is a sequel to \cite{YL1}.
We introduce a category of extended complex manifolds, and prove that the functor describing deformations of a classical compact complex manifold $M$ within this category is versally representable by (an analytic subspace in) $H^*(M,T_M)$. By restricting the associated versal family of extended complex manifolds over $H^*(M,T_M)$ to the subspace $H^1(M,T_M)$ one gets a correct limit to the classical picture.
Let HH_{ab}(H) be the equivariant Hilbert scheme parametrizing the zero dimensional subschemes of the affine plane k^2, fixed under the one dimensional torus T_{ab}={(t^{-b},t^a), t\in k^*} and whose Hilbert function is H. This Hilbert scheme admits a natural stratification in Schubert cells which extends the notion of Schubert cells on Grassmannians. However, the incidence relations between the cells become more complicated than in the case of Grassmannians. In this paper, we give a necessary condition for the closure of a cell to meet another cell. In the particular case of Grassmannians, it coincides with the well known necessary and sufficient incidence condition. There is no known example showing that the condition wouldn't be sufficient.
The Witt group of a smooth curve over a real closed field is explicitely calculated. The method uses a comparison theorem between the graded Witt group and the etale cohomology groups. In the second part of the paper, the torsion Picard group of a smooth real curve is also computed. The calculation depends on a new invariant introduced here. We prove that several problems of real algebraic geometry are related to this invariant.
We compute the Chow motive and the Chow groups with rational coefficients of the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth algebraic surface
Let X be a smooth complex surface of general type such that the image of the canonical map $\phi$ of X is a surface $\Sigma$ and that $\phi$ has degree $\delta\geq 2$. Let $\epsilon\colon S\to \Sigma$ be a desingularization of $\Sigma$ and assume that the geometric genus of S is not zero. Beauville has proved that in this case S is of general type and $\epsilon$ is the canonical map of S. Beauville has also constructed the only infinite series of examples $\phi:X\to \Sigma$ with the above properties that was known up to now. Starting from his construction, we define a {\em good generating pair}, namely a pair $(h:V\to W, L)$ where h is a finite morphism of surfaces and L is a nef and big line bundle of W satisfying certain assumptions. We show that by applying a construction analogous to Beauville's to a good generating pair one obtains an infinite series of surfaces of general type whose canonical map is 2-to-1 onto a canonically embedded surface. In this way we are able to construct more infinite series of such surfaces. In addition, we show that good generating pairs have bounded invariants and that there exist essentially only 2 examples with $\dim |L|>1$. The key fact that we exploit for obtaining these results is that the Albanese variety P of V is a Prym variety and that the fibre of the Prym map over P has positive dimension.
The aim of this paper is to obtain a classification of scrolls of genus 0 and 1, which are defined by a one-dimensional family of lines meeting a certain set of linear spaces in ${\bf P}^n$. These ruled surfaces will be called incidence scrolls and such a set will be the base of the incidence scroll. Unless otherwise stated, we assume that the base spaces are in general position.
Let $X$ be a compact K\"{a}hler manifold, and let $L$ be a line bundle on $X.$ Define $I_k(L)$ to be the kernel of the multiplication map $ Sym^k H^0 (L) \to H^0 (L^k).$ For all $h \leq k,$ we define a map $\rho : I_k(L) \to Hom (H^{p,q} (L^{-h}), H^{p+1,q-1} (L^{k-h})).$ When $L = K_X$ is the canonical bundle, the map $\rho$ computes a second fundamental form associated to the deformations of $X.$ If $X=C$ is a curve, then $\rho$ is a lifting of the Wahl map $I_2(L) \to H^0 (L^2 \otimes K_C^2).$ We also show how to generalize the construction of $\rho$ to the cases of harmonic bundles and of couples of vector bundles.
In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized rational Okamoto-Painlev\'e pair (S, Y) by generalizing the notion of the spaces of initial conditions of Painlev\'e equations. After classifying those pairs, we will establish an algebro-geometric approach to derive the Painlev\'e differential equations from the deformation of Okamoto-Painlev\'e pairs by using the local cohomology groups. Moreover the reason why the Painlev\'e equations can be written in Hamiltonian systems is clarified by means of the holomorphic symplectic structure on S - Y. Hamiltonian structures for Okamoto-Painlev\'e pairs of type $\tilde{E}_7 (= P_{II})$ and $\tilde{D}_8 (= P_{III}^{\tilde{D}_8})$ are calculated explicitly as examples of our theory.
In the theory of deformation of Okamoto-Painlev\'e pair (S,Y), a local cohomology group $H^1_D(\Theta_S(-\log D))$ plays an important role. In this paper, we estimate the local cohomology group of pair (S,Y) for several types, and obtain the following results. For a pair (S,Y) corresponding to the space of initial conditions of the Painlev\'e equations, we show that the local cohomology group $H^1_D(\Theta_S(-\log D))$ is at least 1 dimensional. This fact is the key to understand Painlev\'e equation related to (S,Y). Moreover we show that, for the pairs (S,Y) of type $\tilde{A_8}$, the local cohomology group $H^1_D(\Theta_S(-\log D))$ vanish. Therefore in this case, there is no differential equation on S-Y in the sense of the theory.
In this paper, we introduce the notion of an Okamoto-Painlev\'e pair (S, Y) which consists of a compact smooth complex surface S and an effective divisor Y on S satisfying certain conditions. Though spaces of initial values of Painlev\'e equations introduced by K. Okamoto give examples of Okamoto-Painleve pairs, we find a new example of Okamoto-Painlev\'e pairs not listed in \cite{Oka}. We will give the complete classification of Okamoto-Painlev\'e pairs.
Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over the complex numbers. To every representation $\rho\colon \GL(r)\lra \GL(V)$ of the complex general linear group on the finite dimensional complex vector space $V$ which satisfies the assumption that there be an integer $\alpha$ with $\rho(z \id_{\C^r})=z^\alpha \id_V$ for all $z\in\C^*$ we associate the problem of classifying triples $(E,L,\phi)$ where $E$ is a vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$, $L$ is a line bundle on $X$, and $\phi\colon E_\rho\lra L$ is a non trivial homomorphism. Here, $E_\rho$ is the vector bundle of rank $\dim V$ associated to $E$ via $\rho$. If we take, for example, the standard representation of $\GL(r)$ on $\C^r$ we have to classify triples $(E,L,\phi)$ consisting of $E$ as before and a non-zero homomorphism $\phi\colon E\lra L$ which includes the so-called Bradlow pairs. For the representation of $\GL(r)$ on $S^2\C^3$ we find the conic bundles of Gomez and Sols. In the present paper, we will formulate a general semistability concept for the above triples which depends on a rational parameter $\delta$ and establish the existence of moduli spaces of $\delta$-(semi)stable triples of fixed topological type. The notion of semistability mimics the Hilbert-Mumford criterion for $SL(r)$ which is the main reason that such a general approach becomes feasible. In the known examples (the above, Higgs bundles, extension pairs, oriented framed bundles) we show how to recover the "usual" semistability concept. This process of simplification can also be formalized. Altogether, our results provide a unifying construction for the moduli spaces of most decorated vector bundle problems together with an automatism for finding the right notion of semistability and should therefore be of some interest.
To every oriented tree, we associate a moduli problem for sheaves over a projective manifold $X$. We define the corresponding notion of semistability and establish the existence of moduli spaces. Applying the results to the tree *->*, we obtain a GIT construction for the moduli space of holomorphic triples of Bradlow and Garcia-Prada.
This is an erratum to math.AG/9803126, Tohoku 51 (1999) 489-537. This erratum describes:   1. the failure of the algorithm in [AMR] and [Morelli1] for the strong factorization pointed out by Kalle Karu,   2. the statement of a refined weak factorization theorem for toroidal birational morphisms in [AMR], in the form utilized in [AKMR] for the proof of the weak factorization theorem for general birationla maps, avoiding the use of the above mentioned algorithm for the strong factorization, and 3. a list of corrections for a few other mistakes in [AMR], mostly pointed out by Laurent Bonavero.
This paper is a survey on arc spaces, a recent topic in algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The geometry of the arc space of an algebraic variety yields several new geometric invariants and brings new light to some classical invariants.
This paper is originally designed as a part of revision of the author's preprint math.AG/9908174 "P-adic Schwarzian triangle groups of Mumford type". Recently, Yves Andr'e pointed out a flaw in that preprint; more precisely, Proposition II there was not correct, and consequently, as he pointed out, some triangle groups are missing (but only in p=2,3,5). I apologize to the readers, and will release the other part soon by the original title. In this paper, we concentrate on the constructive part, but more systematically and in more general situation. More precisely, this paper presents a complete criterion for an abstract tree of groups to be realized in the context of p-adic uniformization. This criterion provides a practical way of constructing finitely generated discrete subgroups in PGL(2,K) over a p-adic field K. In the end of this paper, we will exhibit concrete examples of such construction, which in particular shows that there exist infinitely many triangle groups.
We describe the moduli spaces of morphisms between polarized complex abelian varieties. The discrete invariants, derived from a Poincare' decomposition of morphisms, are the types of polarizations and of lattice homomorphisms occurring in the decomposition. For a given type of morphisms the moduli variety is irreducible, and is obtained from a product of Siegel spaces modulo the action of a discrete group.
Let G be a complex reductive group and let C be a smooth curve of genus at least one. We prove a converse to a theorem of Atiyah-Bott concerning the stratification of the space of holomorphic G-bundles on C. In case the genus of C is one, we establish that one has a stratification in the strong sense. The paper concludes with a characterization of the minimally unstable strata in case G is simple.
We prove an equivariant version of Hironaka's theorem on elimination of points of indeterminacy. Our arguments rely on canonical resolution of singularities.
In this short note, we determine the Kodaira dimension and some of the plurigenera of (a desingularization of) a symmetric power of a smooth projective variety. We use it to obtain bounds on the genus of curve passing through a fixed number of general points.
Let V be a convex vector bundle over a smooth projective manifold X, and let Y be the subset of X which is the zero locus of a regular section of V. This mostly expository paper discusses a conjecture which relates the virtual fundamental classes of X and Y. Using an argument due to Gathmann, we prove a special case of the conjecture. The paper concludes with a discussion of how our conjecture relates to the mirror theorems in the literature.
We construct examples of algebraic surfaces with interesting fundamental groups.
Simplicial complexes X provide commutative rings A(X) via the Stanley-Reisner construction. We calculated the cotangent cohomology, i.e., T1 and T2 of A(X) in terms of X. These modules provide information about the deformation theory of the algebro geometric objects assigned to X.
We study Deligne's conjecture on the monodromy weight filtration on the nearby cycles in the mixed characteristic case, and reduce it to the nondegeneracy of certain pairings in the semistable case. We also prove a related conjecture of Rapoport and Zink which uses only the image of the Cech restriction morphism, if Deligne's conjecture holds for a general hyperplane section. In general we show that Deligne's conjecture is true if the standard conjectures hold.
This is a sequal paper to math.AG/9909021. By using the theory of AZD originated by the author, I prove that for every smooth projective $n$-fold $X$ of general type and every \[ m\geq \lceil\sum_{\ell =1}^{n}\sqrt[\ell]{2} \ell\rceil +1, \] $\mid mK_{X}\mid$ gives a birational rational map from $X$ into a projective space, unless it has a nontrivial (relative dimension is positive) rational fiber space structure whose general fiber is birational to a variety of relatively low degree in a projective space.
If a complex analytic function, $f$, has a stratified isolated critical point, then it is known that the cohomology of the Milnor fibre of $f$ has a direct sum decomposition in terms of the normal Morse data to the strata. We use microlocal Morse theory to obtain the same result under the weakened hypothesis that the vanishing cycles along $f$ have isolated support. We also investigate an index-theoretic proof of this fact.
We introduce the notion of lef line bundles on a complex projective manifold. We prove that lef line bundles satisfy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem, the Lefschetz Decomposition and the Hodge-Riemann Bilinear Relations. We study proper holomorphic semismall maps from complex manifolds and prove that, for constant coefficients, the Decomposition Theorem is equivalent to the non-degeneracy of certain intersection forms. We give a proof of the Decomposition Theorem for the complex direct image of the constant sheaf when the domain and the target are projective by proving that the forms in question are non-degenerate. A new feature uncovered by our proof is that the forms are definite.
In this note, we study monodromies of algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle. We prove that on a smooth complex affine curve, any monodromy arises as the underlying local system of an algebraic connection on the trivial bundle. We give a generalization of this for rank one monodromies in higher dimension.
A tetragonal canonical curve is the complete intersection of two divisors on a scroll. The equations can be written in `rolling factors' format. For such homogeneous ideals we give methods to compute infinitesimal deformations. Deformations can be obstructed. For the case of quadratic equations on the scroll we derive explicit base equations. They are used to study extensions of tetragonal curves.
The aim of this paper is to get some results about ruled surfaces which configure a projective theory of scrolls and ruled surfaces. Our ideas follow the viewpoint of Corrado Segre, but we employ the contemporaneous language of locally free sheaves. The results complete the exposition given by R. Hartshorne and they have not appeared before in the contemporaneous literature.
The goal of this work is to pursue the study of pseudo-effective line bundles and vector bundles. Our first result is a generalization of the Hard Lefschetz theorem for cohomology with values in a pseudo-effective line bundle. The Lefschetz map is shown to be surjective when (and, in general, only when) the pseudo-effective line bundle is twisted by its multiplier ideal sheaf. This result has several geometric applications, e.g. to the study of compact K\"ahler manifolds with pseudo-effective canonical or anti-canonical line bundles. Another concern is to understand pseudo-effectivity in more algebraic terms. In this direction, we introduce the concept of an "almost" nef line bundle, and mean by this that the degree of the bundle is nonnegative on sufficiently generic curves. It can be shown that pseudo-effective line bundles are almost nef, and our hope is that the converse also holds true. This can be checked in some cases, e.g. for the canonical bundle of a projective 3-fold.   From this, we derive some geometric properties of the Albanese map of compact K\"ahler 3-folds.
In this paper we study the ample cone of the moduli space $\mgn$ of stable $n$-pointed curves of genus $g$. Our motivating conjecture is that a divisor on $\mgn$ is ample iff it has positive intersection with all 1-dimensional strata (the components of the locus of curves with at least $3g+n-2$ nodes). This translates into a simple conjectural description of the cone by linear inequalities, and, as all the 1-strata are rational, includes the conjecture that the Mori cone is polyhedral and generated by rational curves. Our main result is that the conjecture holds iff it holds for $g=0$. More precisely, there is a natural finite map $r: \vmgn 0. 2g+n. \to \mgn$ whose image is the locus $\rgn$ of curves with all components rational. Any 1-strata either lies in $\rgn$ or is numerically equivalent to a family $E$ of elliptic tails and we show that a divisor $D$ is nef iff $D \cdot E \geq 0$ and $r^*(D)$ is nef. We also give results on contractions (i.e. morphisms with connected fibers to projective varieties) of $\mgn$ for $g \geq 1$ showing that any fibration factors through a tautological one (given by forgetting points) and that the exceptional locus of any birational contraction is contained in the boundary. Finally, by more ad-hoc arguments, we prove the nefness of certain special classes.
We propose a definition of ``nonabelian mixed Hodge structure'' together with a construction associating to a smooth projective variety $X$ and to a nonabelian mixed Hodge structure $V$, the ``nonabelian cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $V$'' which is a (pre-)nonabelian mixed Hodge structure denoted $H=Hom(X_M, V)$. We describe the basic definitions and then give some conjectures saying what is supposed to happen. At the end we compute an example: the case where $V$ has underlying homotopy type the complexified 2-sphere, and mixed Hodge structure coming from its identification with $\pp ^1$. For this example we show that $Hom (X_M,V)$ is a namhs for any smooth projective variety $X$.
We study Mori's three-dimensional contractions $f\colon X\to Z$. It is proved that on the ``good'' model $(\bar X,\bar S)$ the exceptional divisor has no elliptic components of $Diff_{\bar S}$ with coefficients $\ge 6/7$.
A survey of work on motivic integration.
Local models are schemes defined in linear algebra terms that describe the 'etale local structure of integral models for Shimura varieties and other moduli spaces. We point out that the flatness conjecture of Rapoport-Zink on local models fails in the presence of ramification and that in that case one has to modify their definition. We study in detail certain modifications of the local models for G=R_{E/F}GL(n), with E/F a totally ramified extension, and for a maximal parahoric level subgroup. The special fibers of these models are subschemes of the affine Grassmannian. We show that the new local models are smoothly equivalent to "rank varieties" of matrices, are flat, normal, with rational singularities and that their special fibers contain the expected Schubert strata. A corollary is that Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannian are smoothly equivalent to nilpotent orbit closures and are normal with rational singularities, even in positive characteristics. We give some applications to the calculation of sheaves of nearby cycles and describe a relation with geometric convolution. Finally, in the general EL case, we replace the flatness conjecture of Rapoport-Zink with a conjecture about the modified local models.
We prove that the fake projective planes constructed from the diadic discrete group discovered by Cartwright, Mantero, Steger, and Zappa are connected Shimura varieties associated to a certain unitary group. The necessary Shimura data, as well as the unitary group, are explicitly described. We also give a field of definition of these fake projective planes.
Monodromy in analytic families of smooth complex surfaces yields groups of isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms for each family member X. For all deformation classes of minimal elliptic surfaces with p_g>q=0, we determine the monodromy group of a representative X, i.e. the group of isometries of the intersection lattice L_X:=H_2/torsion generated by the monodromy action of all families containing X. To this end we construct families such that any isometry is in the group generated by their monodromies or does not respect the invariance of the canonical class or the spinor norm.
We prove two results on the defining ideals of certain varieties of matrices. Let us fix two positive integers r, e. Let M(r) be the set of r x r matrices over a field K. We consider the closed subscheme of the nilpotent variety of M(r) over K defined by the conditions char_A(T)=T^r, A^e=0. We prove that when the characteristic of K is zero this scheme is reduced. Also for e=2 we prove that this scheme is reduced over a field K of arbitrary characteristic.   These results were motivated by the questions of G. Pappas and M. Rapoport (compare their paper ''Local models in the ramified case I. The EL-case", math.AG/0006222) and give answers to some of their conjectures.
M. Nori proved that on a projective smooth variety, a bundle is finite, (that is the ring it generates has dimension 0), if and only if it trivializes on a finite cover. In this note, we consider bundles of degree 0 on an elliptic curve. We prove that the dimension of the ring generated by such a bundle is the same as the dimension of a torsor trivializing the bundle (and is 1).
This is the Foreword to the book ``Explicit birational geometry of 3-folds'', edited by A. Corti and M. Reid, CUP Jun 2000, ISBN: 0 521 63641 8, with papers by K. Altmann, A. Corti, A.R. Iano-Fletcher, J. Koll\'ar, A.V. Pukhlikov and M. Reid.  One of the main achievements of algebraic geometry over the last 20 years is the work of Mori and others extending minimal models and the Enriques--Kodaira classification to 3-folds. This book is an integrated suite of papers centred around applications of Mori theory to birational geometry. Four of the papers (those by Pukhlikov, Fletcher, Corti, and the long joint paper Corti, Pukhlikov and Reid) work out in detail the theory of birational rigidity of Fano 3-folds; these contributions work for the first time with a representative class of Fano varieties, 3-fold hypersurfaces in weighted projective space, and include an attractive introductory treatment and a wealth of detailed computation of special cases.
In this paper we give a description of hypersurfaces with trivial ring $AK(S)$, introduced by the second author as following. Let $X$ be an affine variety and let $G(X)$ be the group generated by all $\Bbb {C}^+$-actions on $X$. Then $AK(X)$ is the subring of all regular $G(X)-$ invariant functions on $X.$ We show that a smooth affine surface $S$ with $AK(S)=\Bbb C$ is quasihomogeneous and so may be obtained from a smooth rational projective surface by deleting a divisor of special form, which is called a ``zigzag''. We denote by $A$ the set of all such surfaces, and by $H$ those which have only three components in the zigzag. We prove that for a surface $S \in A$ the following statements are equivalent:  1. $S$ is isomorphic to a hypersurface;  2. $S$ is isomorphic to a hypersurface, defined by equation $xy=p(z)$ in $\Bbb {C}^3 ,$ where $p$ is a polynomial with simple roots only;  3. $S$ admits a fixed-point free $\Bbb {C}^+$- action;  4. $S\in H.$ Moreover, if $S_1 $ belongs to $H,$ and $S_2$ does not, then $S_1\times \Bbb {C}^k\not\cong S_2\times \Bbb {C}^k$ for any $k\in\Bbb N$.
A Brill-Noether locus is a subvariety of M_g consisting of curves having certain linear series g^r_d. We study the relative position of Brill-Noether loci with respect to the gonality stratification of M_g. We construct smooth curves in P^r of given degree and genus and having the `expected' gonality. As an application we give a new proof of our result about the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus 23.
We present formulas for the homogenous multivariate resultant as a quotient of two determinants. They extend classical Macaulay formulas, and involve matrices of considerably smaller size, whose non zero entries include coefficients of the given polynomials and coefficients of their Bezoutian. These formulas can also be viewed as an explicit computation of the morphisms and the determinant of a resultant complex.
We prove that a variation of graded-polarizable mixed Hodge structure over a punctured disk with unipotent monodromy, has a limiting mixed Hodge structure at the puncture (i.e., it is admissible in the sense of [SZ]) which splits over $\R$, if and only if certain grading of the complexified weight filtration, depending smoothly on the Hodge filtration, extends across the puncture. In particular, the result exactly supplements Schmid's Theorem for pure structures, which holds for the graded variation, and gives a Hodge-theoretic condition for the relative monodromy weight filtration to exist.
We determine the class of the Hilbert scheme of points on a surface in the Grothendieck group of varieties. As a corollary we obtain its class in the Grothendieck group of motives. We give some applications to moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces. The paper is related to math/0005249 of de Cataldo and Migliorini.
The characteristic cycle of a complex of sheaves on a complex analytic space provides weak information about the complex; essentially, it yields the Euler characteristics of the hypercohomology of normal data to strata. We show how perverse cohomology actually allows one to extract the individual Betti numbers of the hypercohomology of normal data to strata, not merely the Euler characteristics. We apply this to the ``calculation'' of the vanishing cycles of a complex, and relate this to the work of Parusi\'nski and Brian\c{c}on, Maisonobe, and Merle on Thom's $a_f$ condition.
Recall that the moduli space of smooth (that is, stable) cubic curves is isomorphic to the quotient of the upper half plane by the group of fractional linear transformations with integer coefficients. We establish a similar result for stable cubic surfaces: the moduli space is biholomorphic to a quotient of the compex 4-ball by an explict arithmetic group generated by complex reflections. This identification gives interesting structural information on the moduli space and allows one to locate the points in complex hyperbolic 4-space corresponding to cubic surfaces with symmetry, e.g., the Fermat cubic surface.   Related results, not quite as extensive, were announced in alg-geom/9709016.
The Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of varieties of degree r and dimension n in the r-dimensional projective space that have an extremal secant line, is at least d-r+n+1. We classify these varieties and show that their regularity is exactly d-r+n+1, as predicted by the regularity conjecture.
New relations among the genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants of a complex projective manifold $X$ are exhibited. When the cohomology of $X$ is generated by divisor classes and classes ``with vanishing one-point invariants,'' the relations determine many-point invariants in terms of one-point invariants.
A simple corollary of the localization theorem (due to the author and, independently, to Lian-Liu-Yau) is applied to several problems in enumerative geometry. New formulas for Schubert calculus on flag manifolds, due to Kong, and a new reconstruction theorem for genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants, due to Bertram-Kley, are discussed, as well as some simple functorial properties of Givental's J-function. This paper will appear in the issue of the Michigan Mathematical Journal dedicated to Bill Fulton.
Let X,Y be algebraic curves in P^n over C. We give an effective description of the join J(X,Y)\in P^n of X and Y in terms of local parametrizations of X and Y.
We give a proof of generalizations of the classical Arakelov inequality valid for the degree $d$ of the relative canoincal bundle of a family of curves of genus $g$ over a complete curve of genus $p$ under the assumption that the monodromy around the singular fibers is unipotent. This relative canonical bundle is the (canonical extension of) the Hodge bundle and the inequality is generalized to the degrees of the Hodge bundles of a complex variation of Hodge structures.
This is a continuation of "Mirror Principle III"(math.AG/9912038).
Given a family of complex affine planes, we show that it is trivial over a Zariski open subset of the base. The proof relies upon a relative version of the contraction theorem.
This paper surveys the authors recent work on two variable elliptic genus of singular varieties. The last section calculates a generating function for the elliptic genera of symmetric products. This generalizes the classical results of Macdonald and Zagier.
In this paper, we introduce and study two new types of non-abelian zeta functions for curves over finite fields, which are defined by using (moduli spaces of) semi-stable vector bundles and non-stable bundles. A Riemann-Weil type hypothesis is formulated for zeta functions associated to semi-stable bundles, which we think is more canonical than the other one. All this is motivated by (and hence explains in a certain sense) our work on non-abelian zeta functions for number fields.
In this paper, we introduce a geometrically stylized arithmetic cohomology for number fields. Based on such a cohomology, we define and study new yet genuine non-abelian zeta functions for number fields, using an intersection stability.
In this paper we show a Zariski pair of sextics which is not a degeneration of the original example given by Zariski. This is the first example of this kind known. The two curves of the pair have a trivial Alexander polynomial. The difference in the topology of their complements can only be detected via finer invariants or techniques. In our case the generic braid monodromies, the fundamental groups, the characteristic varieties and the existence of dihedral coverings of $\PP^2$ ramified along them can be used to distinguish the two sextics. Our intention is not only to use different methods and give a general description of them but also to bring together different perspectives of the same problem.
In this paper, we show that the B\"acklund transformations of Painlev\'e equations come from birational maps of rational surfaces constructed by Okamoto as the spaces of initial conditions.  The simultaneous resolutions of rational double points of the families of rational surfaces give rise to flops which are origins of symmetry groups of Painlev\'e equation. Moreover we point out that Kodaira--Spencer theory of deformations of rational surfaces explains a geomrtric meaning of Painlev\'e equations.
Given a tame Galois branched cover of curves pi: X -> Y with any finite Galois group G whose representations are rational, we compute the dimension of the (generalized) Prym variety corresponding to any irreducible representation \rho of G. This formula can be applied to the study of algebraic integrable systems using Lax pairs, in particular systems associated with Seiberg-Witten theory. However, the formula is much more general and its computation and proof are entirely algebraic.
We present a complete list of extremal elliptic K3 surfaces. There are altogether 325 of them. The first 112 coincides with Miranda-Persson's list for semi-stable ones. The data include the transcendental lattice which determines uniquely the K3 surface by a result of Shioda and Inose, the singular fibre type and the Mordell Weil group. As an application, we give a sufficient condition for the topological fundamental group of complement to an ADE-configuration of smooth rational curves on a K3 surface to be trivial.
We decompose the Marsden-Weinstein reductions for the moment map associated to representations of a quiver. The decomposition involves symmetric products of deformations of Kleinian singularities, as well as other terms. As a corollary we deduce that the Marsden-Weinstein reductions are irreducible varieties.
The space of Hodge cycles of the general Prym variety is proved to be generated by its Neron-Severi group.
We consider p-divisible groups (also called Barsotti-Tate groups) in characteristic p, their deformations, and we draw some conclusions.   For such a group we can define its Newton polygon (abbreviated NP). This is invariant under isogeny. For an abelian variety (in characteristic p) the Newton polygon of its p-divisible group is ``symmetric''.   In 1963 Manin conjectured that conversely any symmetric Newton polygon is ``algebroid''; i.e., it is the Newton polygon of an abelian variety. This conjecture was shown to be true and was proved with the help of the ``Honda-Serre-Tate theory''. We give another proof.   Grothendieck showed that Newton polygons ``go up'' under specialization: no point of the Newton polygon of a closed fiber in a family is below the Newton polygon of the generic fiber. In 1970 Grothendieck conjectured the converse: any pair of comparable Newton polygons appear for the generic and special fiber of a family. This was extended by Koblitz in 1975 to a conjecture about a sequence of comparable Newton polygons. We prove these conjectures.
We prove that if X is a locally complete intersection variety, then X has all the jet schemes irreducible if and only if X has canonical singularities. After embedding X in a smooth variety Y, we use motivic integration to express the condition that X has irreducible jet schemes in terms of data coming from an embedded resolution of X in Y. We show that this condition is equivalent with having canonical singularities. In the appendix, this result is used to prove a generalization of Kostant's freeness theorem to the setting of jet schemes.
This paper generalizes for non-abelian theta functions a number of formulae valid for theta functions of Jacobian varieties. The addition formula, the relation with the Szego kernel and with the multicomponent KP hierarchy and the behavior under cyclic coverings are given.
For a cubic surface X, by considering the intermediate Jacobian J(Y) of the triple covering Y of the 3-dimensional projective space branching along X, Allcock, Carlson and Toledo constructed a period map per from the family of marked cubic surfaces to the four dimensional complex ball embedded in the Siegel upper half space of degree 5. We give an expression of the inverse of per in terms of theta constants by constructing an isomorphism between J(Y) and a Prym variety of a cyclic 6-ple covering of the projective line branching at seven points.
Let $\psi$ be the period map for a family of the cyclic triple coverings of the complex projective line branching at six points. The symmetric group $S_6$ acts on this family and on its image under $\psi.$ In this paper, we give an $S_6$-equivariant expression of $\psi^{-1}$ in terms of fifteen theta constants.
The relation between the uniformizing equation of the complex hyperbolic structure on the moduli space of marked cubic surfaces and an Appell-Lauricella hypergeometric system in nine variables is clarified.
We study the birationality (onto its image) of the Abel-Prym morphism associated with a Prym-Tuyrin variety. We use such result to prove that Picard bundles over Prym varieties are simple and moreover they are stable when the Abel-Prym morphism is not birational. As a consequence we obtain that Picard bundles over moduli spaces of stable vector bundles with fixed determinant are simple. We prove that Picard bundles over moduli spaces of rank 2 vector bundles on curves of genus 2 bundles are stable.
We describe genus g>1 potentials of semisimple Frobenius structures. Our formula can be considered as a definition in the axiomatic context of Frobenius manifolds. In Gromov-Witten theory, it becomes a conjecture expressing higher genus GW-invariants in terms of genus 0 GW-invariants of symplectic manifolds with generically semisimple quantum cup-product. The conjecture is supported by the corresponding theorem about equivariant GW-invariants of tori actions with isolated fixed points. The parallel theory of gravitational descendents is also presented.
To a Hodge structure V of weight k with CM by a field K we associate Hodge structures V_{-n/2} of weight k+n for n positive and, under certain circumstances, also for n negative. We show that these `half twists' come up naturally in the Kuga-Satake varieties of weight two Hodge structures with CM by an imaginary quadratic field.
We classify two-variable polynomials which are rational of simple type. These are precisely the two-variable polynomials with trivial homological monodromy.
In the 80's D. Eisenbud and J. Harris considered the following problem: ``What are the limits of Weierstrass points in families of curves degenerating to stable curves?'' But for the case of stable curves of compact type, treated by them, this problem remained wide open since then. In the present article, we propose a concrete approach to this problem, and give a quite explicit solution for stable curves with just two irreducible components meeting at points in general position.
We determine the complete list of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth log del Pezzo surfaces in weighted projective 3-spaces. We prove that many of these admit a K\"ahler-Einstein metric and most of them do not have tigers.
In this note we study algebras of chiral differential operators over an algebraic group and over homogeneous spaces $G/G'$ where $G$ is simple and $G'$ is unipotent or parabolic.
We show that elliptic solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation can be obtained from triple Massey products on elliptic curve. We introduce the associative version of this equation which has two spectral parameters and construct its elliptic solutions. We also study some degenerations of these solutions.
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a big and nef line bundle L of any degree on a K3 surface or Enriques surface to be k-very ample and k-spanned. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a spanned and big line bundle on a K3 surface to be birationally k-very ample and birationally k-spanned, and relate these concepts to the Clifford index and gonality of smooth curves in |L|.
A Hodge structure V of weight k on which a CM field acts defines, under certain conditions, a Hodge structure of weight k-1, its half twist. In this paper we consider hypersurfaces in projective space with a cyclic automorphism which defines an action of a cyclotomic field on a Hodge substructure in the cohomology. We determine when the half twist exists and relate it to the geometry and moduli of the hypersurfaces. We use our results to prove the existence of a Kuga-Satake correspondance for certain cubic 4-folds.
In the 80's M. Cornalba and J. Harris discovered a relation among the Hodge class and the boundary classes in the Picard group with rational coefficients of the moduli space of stable, hyperelliptic curves. They proved the relation by computing degrees of the classes involved for suitable one-parameter families. In the present article we show that their relation can be obtained as the class of an appropriate, geometrically meaningful empty set, thus conforming with C. Faber's general philosophy to finding relations among tautological classes in the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves. The empty set we consider is the closure of the locus of smooth, hyperelliptic curves having a special ramification point.
We determine the complete list of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth log Fano 3-folds in weighted projective 4-spaces. This implies that the Reid-Fletcher list of 95 types of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth terminal Fano threefolds in weighted projective 4-spaces is complete. We also prove that there are only finitely many families of quasi smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of any given dimension.
We prove a representability theorem for moduli functors of framed torsion-free sheaves on nonsingular complex projective surfaces, using formal geometry along a curve in the surface. This has as a consequence that a certain restriction morphism for moduli stacks of sheaves has fibers that are schemes.
Fix a ruled surface S obtained as the projective completion of a line bundle L on a complex elliptic curve; we study the moduli problem of parametrizing certain pairs consisting of a sheaf E on S and a map of E to a fixed reference sheaf on S. We prove that the full moduli stack for this problem is representable by a scheme in some cases. Moreover, the moduli stack admits an action by the group ${\mathbf C}^*$, and we determine its fixed-point set, which leads in some special cases to explicit formulas for the rational homology of the moduli space.
We describe a method of computing equivariant and ordinary intersection cohomology of certain varieties with actions of algebraic tori, in terms of structure of the zero- and one-dimensional orbits. The class of varieties to which our formula applies includes Schubert varieties in flag varieties and affine flag varieties. We also prove a monotonicity result on local intersection cohomology stalks.
Previous results on genera g of F_{q^2}-maximal curves are improved: (1) Either g\leq (q^2-q+4)/6, or g=\lfloor(q-1)^2/4\rfloor, or g=q(q-1)/2; (2) The hypothesis on the existence of a particular Weierstrass point in \cite{at} is proved; (3) For q\equiv 1\pmod{3}, q\ge 13, no F_{q^2}-maximal curve of genus (q-1)(q-2)/3 exists; (4) For q\equiv 2\pmod{3}, q\ge 11, the non-singular F_{q^2}-model of the plane curve of equation y^q+y=x^{(q+1)/3} is the unique F_{q^2}-maximal curve of genus g=(q-1)(q-2)/6; (5) Assume \dim(\cD_\cX)=5, and char(\fq)\geq 5. For q\equiv 1\pmod{4}, q\geq 17, the Fermat curve of equation x^{(q+1)/2}+y^{(q+1)/2}+1=0 is the unique F_{q^2}-maximal curve of genus g=(q-1)(q-3)/8. For q\equiv 3\pmod{4}, q\ge 19, there are exactly two F_{q^2}-maximal curves of genus g=(q-1)(q-3)/8, namely the above Fermat curve and the non-singular F_{q^2}-model of the plane curve of equation y^q+y=x^{(q+1)/4}. The above results provide some new evidences on maximal curves in connection with Castelnuovo's bound and Halphen's theorem, especially with extremal curves; see for instance the conjecture stated in Introduction.
Smooth surfaces have finitely generated canonical rings and projective canonical models. For normal surfaces, however, the graded ring of multicanonical sections is possibly nonnoetherian, such that the corresponding homogeneous spectrum is noncompact. I construct a canonical compactification by adding finitely many non-Q-Gorenstein points at infinity, provided that each Weil divisor is numerically equivalent to a Q-Cartier divisor. Similar results hold for arbitrary Weil divisors instead of the canonical class.
We prove that a smooth hypersurface of degree >2 and dimension >1 admits no endomorphism of degree >1 (for hyperquadrics this is due to Paranjape and Srinivas). We then collect some general results on endomorphisms of projective manifolds; we prove in particular that ramified endomorphisms occur only on varieties of negative Kodaira dimension, and we classify those Del Pezzo surfaces which admit such endomorphism.
We compute the transcendental part of the normal function corresponding to the Deligne class of a cycle in K_1 of a mirror family of quartic K3 surfaces. The resulting multivalued function does not satisfy the hypergeometric differential equation of the periods and we conclude that the cycle is indecomposable for most points in the mirror family. The occurring inhomogenous Picard-Fuchs equation are related to Painlev\'e VI type differential equations.
Let X be a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic p>0. We show that the Hitchin morphism, which associates to a Higgs bundle its characteristic polynomial, has a non-trivial deformation over the affine line. This deformation is constructed by considering the moduli stack of t-connections on vector bundles on X and an analogue of the p-curvature, and by observing that the associated characteristic polynomial is, in a suitable sense, a p-th power.
We show that a general plane curve of degree at least 4 is uniquely determined by the full set of its bitangent lines. This problem has an elementary solution for degree at least 5, and the paper is almost entirely devoted to curves of degree 4, where we generalize the result to nodal quartics. In other words, we show that a general curve of genus 3 can be recovered from its 28 odd theta-characteristics.
In this paper, we consider moduli spaces of stable sheaves on abelian surfaces. Our main assumption is the primitivity of the associated Mukai vector. We construct many isomorphisms of muduli spaces induced by Fourier-Mukai functor. As an application, we show that deformation type of these spaces are determined by their dimension. We next show that the fiber of the albanese map is irreducible symplectic manifolds In particular, we describe the period by using Mukai lattice.   We also discuss deformation type of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces.
Let $G$ be an algebraic group and let $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}$ be the corresponding affine algebra on some level. Consider the induced module $V:=Ind^{\widetilde{\mathfrak g}}_{{\mathfrak g}[[t]](O_{G[[t]]})$, where $O_{G[[t]]}$ is the ring of regular functions on the group $G[[t]]$.   In this paper we show that $V$ is naturally a vertex operator algebra, which is "responsible" for D-modules on the loop group $G((t))$. Using the techiques of VOA we show that $V$ is in fact a bimodule over the affine algebra. In addition, we show that $V$ possesses a remarkable property related to its BRST reduction with respect to $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}$.   This paper has a considerable intersection with a recent preprint of Gorbunov, Malikov and Schechtman.
Let k be an algebraically closed field and X a smooth projective k-variety. A famous theorem of A. A. Roitman states that the canonical map from the degree zero part of the Chow group of zero cycles on X to the group of k-points of its Albanese variety induces an isomorphism on torsion prime to the characteristic of k. In the present paper we prove a generalisation to quasi-projective varieties admitting a smooth compactification. As was first observed by Ramachandran, for such a generalisation one should replace the Chow group of zero cycles by Suslin's 0-th algebraic singular homology group and the Albanese variety by the generalised Albanese of Serre. The method of proof is new even in the projective case and makes the motivic nature of the Albanese transparent. We also prove that the generalised Albanese map is an isomorphism if k is the algebraic closure of a finite field.
We show that a generic vector field on an affine space of positive characteristic admits an invariant algebraic hypersurface. This contrast with Jouanolou's Theorem that shows that in characteristic zero the situation is completely opposite. That is a generic vector field in the complex plane does not admit any invariant algebraic curve.
In these notes we present a corrected version of the algorithm for abelianization of stabilizers of finite group actions on smooth manifolds using equivariant blow ups.
The classification of projective elliptic line scrolls with the description of their singular loci is given. In particular we recover Atiyah Theorem by using classical methods.
A group action on a smooth variety provides it with the natural stratification by irreducible components of the fixed point sets of arbitrary subgroups. We show that the corresponding maximal wonderful blowup in the sense of MacPherson-Procesi has only abelian stabilizers. The result is inspired by the abelianization algorithm of Batyrev.
This paper contains some applications of Fourier-Mukai techniques to the birational geometry of threefolds. In particular, we prove that birational Calabi-Yau threefolds have equivalent derived categories. To do this we show how flops arise naturally as moduli spaces of perverse coherent sheaves.
Classification theory and the study of projective varieties which are covered by rational curves of minimal degrees naturally leads to the study of families of singular rational curves. Since families of arbitrarily singular curves are hard to handle, it has been shown in a previous paper that there exists a partial resolution of singularities which transforms a bundle of possibly badly singular curves into a bundle of nodal and cuspidal plane cubics.   In cases which are of interest for classification theory, the total spaces of these bundles will clearly be projective. It is, however, generally false that an arbitrary bundle of plane cubics is globally projective. For that reason the question of projectivity seems to be of interest, and the present work gives a characterization of the projective bundles.
We study polystable Higgs bundles twisted by a line bundle over a compact K\"ahler manifold. These form a Tannakian category when the first and second Chern classes of the bundle are zero. In this paper we identify the corresponding Tannaka group in the case in which the line bundle is of finite order. This group is described in terms of the pro-reductive completion of the fundamental group of the manifold, and the character associated to the line bundle.
We give upper and lower bounds for the order of the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. We also give a generalization to higher genera of the famous formula $12 \lambda_1=\delta$ for genus 1.
Let M be a moduli space of stable sheaves on a K3 or Abelian surface S. We express the class of the diagonal in the cartesian square of M in terms of the Chern classes of a universal sheaf. Consequently, we obtain generators of the cohomology ring of M. When S is a K3 and M is the Hilbert scheme of length n subschemes, this set of generators is sufficiently small in the sense that there aren't any relations among them in the stable cohomology ring.   When S is the cotangent bundle of a Riemann surface, we recover the result of T. Hausel and M. Thaddeus: The cohomology ring of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles is generated by the universal classes.
The class in the Brauer group of a quaternion algebra over a field is 2-torsion. We study the following question: Which 2-torsion elements of the Brauer group of a complex function field are representable by quaternion algebras? Using intersection theory to show that a certain cohomology class (on a smooth projective model) is the class of an algebraic cycle, we arrive at an obstruction, defined on a subgroup of the 2-torsion of the Brauer group, to representability by quaternion algebras. For the function fields of some complex threefolds, the obstruction map is computed and found to be nontrivial.
Smooth complex surfaces polarized with an ample and globally generated line bundle of degree three and four, such that the adjoint bundle is not globally generated, are considered. Scrolls of a vector bundle over a smooth curve are shown to be the only examples in degree three. Two classes of examples in degree four are presented, one of which is shown to characterize regular such pairs. A Reider-type theorem is obtained in which the assumption on the degree of the polarization is removed.
We classify minimal pairs (X, G) for smooth rational projective surface X and finite group G of automorphisms on X. We also determine the fixed locus X^G and the quotient surface Y = X/G as well as the fundamental group of the smooth part of Y. The realization of each pair is included. Mori's extremal ray theory and recent results of Alexeev and also Ambro on the existence of good anti-canonical divisors are used.
We express the product of the cohomology ring of the Hilbert scheme in terms of the center of the algebra of the symmetric group. We give a conjecture for the case of crepant resolutions of symplectic quotient singularities.
The integral cohomology ring of the Hilbert scheme of n-tuples on the affine plane is shown to be isomorphic to the graded ring associated to a filtration of the ring of integral class functions on the symmetric group.
We give an explicit formula for the exponents (i.e. the spectra up to the shift by one) of an irreducible plane curve singularity in terms of Puiseux pairs. As an application we prove in this case Hertling's conjecture that the variance (i.e. the square of the standard deviation) of the exponents is bounded by the difference between the maximal and minimal exponents divided by 12.
By proving a particular case of a conjecture of Drezet, we show that a component of the Maruyama scheme of the semi-stable sheaves on the projective space $\PP^n$ of rank n and Chern polynomial $(1+t)^{n+2}$ is isomorphic to the Kronecher moduli $N(n+1,2,n+2)$, for any odd n. In particular, such scheme defines a smooth minimal compactification of the moduli space of the rational normal curves in $\PP^n$, that generalizes the construction defined by G. Ellinsgrud, R. Piene and S. Str{\o}mme in the case $n=3$.
Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristics, with algebraically closed residue field k. We study the existence problem of equivariant liftings to R of Galois covers of nodal curves over k. Using formal geometry, we show that this problem is actually a local one. We apply this local-to-global principle to obtain new results concerning the existence of such liftings.
Given a del Pezzo surface of degree d between 1 and 6, possibly with rational double points, we construct a "tautological" holomorphic G-bundle over X, where G is a reductive group which is an appropriate conformal form of the simply connected complex linear group whose coroot lattice is isomorphic to the primitive cohomology of the minimal resolution of X. For example, in case d=3 and X is a smooth cubic surface, the rank 27 vector bundle over X associated to the G-bundle constructed above and the standard 27-dimensional representation of E_6 is a direct sum of the line bundles associated to the 27 lines on X. We also discuss the restriction of the G-bundle to smooth hyperplane sections.
Let X be a smooth complex projective variety, and let Y in X be a smooth very ample hypersurface such that -K_Y is nef. Using the technique of relative Gromov-Witten invariants, we give a new short and geometric proof of (a version of) the "mirror formula", i.e. we show that the generating function of the genus zero 1-point Gromov-Witten invariants of Y can be obtained from that of X by a certain change of variables (the so-called "mirror transformation"). Moreover, we use the same techniques to give a similar expression for the (virtual) numbers of degree-d plane rational curves meeting a smooth cubic at one point with multiplicity 3d, which play a role in local mirror symmetry.
Let $f:\Cal C\to S$ be a flat family of curves over a smooth curve $S$ such that $f$ is smooth over $S_0=S\ssm\{s_0\}$ and $f^{-1}(s_0)=\Cal C_0$ is irreducible with one node. We have an associated family $\Cal M_{S_0}\to S_0$ of moduli spaces of semistable vector bundles and the relative theta line bundle $\Theta_{S_0}$. We are interested in the problem: to find suitable degeneration $\Cal M_S$ of moduli spaces and extension $\Theta_S$ of theta line bundles such that the direct image of $\Theta_S$ is a vector bundle on $S$ with a logarithmic projective connection. In this paper, we figured out the conditions of existence of the connection and solved the problem for rank one.
In this article we study the inverse of the period map for the family $\mathcal{F}$ of complex algebraic curves of genus 6 equipped with an automorphism of order 5. This is a family with 2 parameters, and is fibred over a certain type of Del Pezzo surace. The period satisfies the hypergeometric differential equation for Appell's $F_1({3/5},{3/5},{2/5},{6/5})$ of two variables after a certain normalization of the variable parameter. This differential equation and the family $\mathcal{F}$ are studied by G. Shimura (1964), T. Terada (1983, 1985), P. Deligne - G.D. Mostow (1986) and T. Yamazaki- M. Yoshida(1984). Recently M. Yoshida presented a new approch using the concept of configration space. Based on their results we show the representation of the inverse of the period map in terms of Riemann theta constants. This is the first variant of the work of H. Shiga (1981) and K. Matsumoto (1989, 2000) to the co-compact case.
For a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g > 1$, $\Hom(\pi_1(X), PU(p,q))/PU(p,q)$ is the moduli space of flat $PU(p,q)$-connections on $X$. There are two invariants, the Chern class $c$ and the Toledo invariant $\tau$ associated with each element in the moduli. The Toledo invariant is bounded in the range $-2min(p,q)(g-1) \le \tau \le 2min(p,q)(g-1)$. This paper shows that the component, associated with a fixed $\tau > 2(max(p,q)-1)(g-1)$ (resp. $\tau < -2(max(p,q)-1)(g-1)$) and a fixed Chern class $c$, is connected (The restriction on $\tau$ implies $p=q$).
A component of the moduli space M_g(Y,b) of stable maps from genus g curves to a variety Y is said to be regular if it is generically smooth and of the expected dimension provided by deformation theory. In this note we prove existence of regular components of M_g(Y,b) when Y is a product of projective spaces. This result can also be seen as a general position theorem for Brill-Noether loci in M_g.
Suppose that $\Phi:X\to Y$ is a morphism from a 3 fold to a surface (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero). We prove that there exist sequences of blowups of nonsingular subvarieties $X_1\to X$ and $Y_1\to Y$ such that the morphism $\Phi_1:X_1\to Y_1$ is a ``Monomial Morphism''. As a corollary, we show that we can make $\Phi_1$ a toroidal morphism.
In this paper we prove the topological uniqueness of maximal arrangements of a real plane algebraic curve with respect to three lines. More generally, we prove the topological uniqueness of a maximally arranged algebraic curve on a real toric surface. We use the moment map as a tool for studying the topology of real algebraic curves and their complexifications.
We show that the moduli space of rational elliptic surfaces admitting a section is locally a complex hyperbolic variety of dimension eight. We compare its Satake-Baily-Borel compactification with a compactification obtained by means of geometric invariant theory, considered by Miranda.
Let k be a p-adic field. Some time ago, D. Harbater [9] proved that any finite group G may be realized as a regular Galois group over the rational function field in one variable k(t), namely there exists a finite field extension $F/k(t)$, Galois with group G, such that F is a regular extension of k (i.e. k is algebraically closed in F). Moreover, one may arrange that a given k-place of k(t) be totally split in F. Harbater proved this theorem for k an arbitrary complete valued field. Rather formal arguments ([10, \S 4.5]; \S2 hereafter) then imply that the theorem holds over any `large' field k. This in turn is a special case of a result of Pop [15], hence will be referred to as the Harbater/Pop theorem. We refer to [10], [16], [6] for precise references to the literature (work of D\`ebes, Deschamps, Fried, Haran, Harbater, Jarden, Liu, Pop, Serre, and V\"olklein).   Most proofs (see [10], [19, 8.4.4, p.~93] and Liu's contribution to [16]; see however [15]) first use direct arguments to establish the theorem when G is a cyclic group (here the nature of the ground field is irrelevant), then proceed by patching, using either formal or rigid geometry, together with GAGA theorems.   In the present paper, where I take the case of algebraically closed fields for granted, I show how a technique recently developed by Koll\'ar [12] may be used to give a quite different proof of the Harbater/Pop theorem, when the `large' field k has characteristic zero. This proof actually gives more than the original result (see comment after statement of Theorem 1).
This paper forms the major portion of a talk given at the International Colloquium on Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry at TIFR, Mumbai in Jan 2000. We look at the problem of detecting cycles with trivial Abel-Jacobi invariant. M. Green proposed a Hodge-theoretic method to which C. Voisin found a counter-example. We present an easier example. We also propose another possible invariant to detect these classes using Hodge Theory. Similar methods have been proposed earlier by M. Asakura and M. Saito.
The article investigates the following question: given a projective variety X acted on by a connected and reductive group G, which is the relationship between the Gromov-Witten invariants of X and those of X//G? In this study we shall also try to give an algebraic approach to the so called Hamiltonian Gromov-Witten invariants which have appeared rather recenly in the literature.
We study one parameter deformations of a pair consisting of an analytic singular space $X_0$ and a function $f_0$ on it, in case this defines an isolated singularity. We prove, under general conditions, a bouquet decomposition of the Milnor fibre when the isolated singularity splits in the deformation and the invariance of the Milnor fibration if there is no splitting.
Let $k$ be an integer such that $1\leq k\leq n-5$, and $X_{2n-2-k}\subset \mathbf P^n$ a general projective hypersurface of degree $d=2n-2-k$. In this paper we prove that the only $k$-dimensional subvariety $Y$ of $X_{2n-2-k}$ having geometric genus zero is the one covered by the lines. As an immediate corollary we obtain that, for $n>5$, the general $X_{2n-3}\subset \mathbf P^n$, contains no rational curves of degree $\delta >1$.
For a finite Abelian subgroup A of SL(3,C), Ito and Nakajima proved that the tautological bundles on the A-Hilbert scheme Y = A-Hilb(C^3) form a basis of the K-theory of Y. We establish the relations between these bundles in the Picard group of Y and hence, following a recipe introduced by Reid, construct an explicit basis of the integral cohomology of Y in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible representations of A.
This note briefly reviews the {\it Mirror Principle} as developed in the series of papers \LLYI\LLYII\LLYIII\LLYIV\LCHY. We illustrate this theory with a few new examples. One of them gives an intriguing connection to a problem of counting holomorphic disks and annuli. This note has been submitted for the proceedings of the Workshop on Strings, Duality and Geometry the C.R.M. in Montreal of March 2000.
The (small) quantum cohomology ring of a flag manifold F encodes enumerative geometry of rational curves on F. We give a proof of the presentation of the ring and of a quantum Giambelli formula, which is more direct and geometric than the previously known proof. Furthermore, this proof gives a relationship between quantum Schubert polynomials and universal Schubert polynomials, which arise in a degeneracy locus formula of Fulton.
Let $X$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ such that $K_X$ is not nef. We give a characterization of non nef extremal rays of $X$ of maximal length (i.e of length $n-1$); in the case of $\ch(k) = 0$ we also characterize non nef rays of length $n-2$.
The notion of a holomorphically symplectic manifold can be generalized to the singular one. This paper studies the birational contraction maps between symplectic varieties, and then describes the deformation of a symplectic variety which has a symplectic resolution. Some examples are also included.
This paper deals with symplectic varieties which do not have symplectic resolutions. Some moduli spaces of semi-stable torsion-free sheaves on a K3 surface, and symplectic V-manifolds are such varieties.  We shall prove local Torelli theorem for symplectic varieties. Some results on symplectic singularities are also included.
A stratification of a singular set, e.g. an algebraic or analytic variety, is, roughly, a partition of it into manifolds so that these manifolds fit together "regularly". A classical theorem of Whitney says that any complex analytic set has a stratification. This result was extended by Lojasiewicz to real (semi)analytic sets. In this paper we present a short geometric proof of existence of stratifications based on Thom's transversality theorem and Milnor's curve selection lemma and not relying on difficult results of Lojasiewicz.
In this paper we compute upper bounds for the number of ordinary triple points on a hypersurface in $P^3$ and give a complete classification for degree six (degree four or less is trivial, and five is elementary). But the real purpose is to point out the intricate geometry of examples with many triple points, and how it fits with the general classification of surfaces.
We show that the fundamental group of the complement of any irreducible tame torus sextics in $\bf P^2$ is isomorphic to $\bf Z_2*\bf Z_3$ except one class. The exceptional class has the configuration of the singularities $\{C_{3,9},3A_2\}$ and the fundamental group is bigger than $\bf Z_2*\bf Z_3$. In fact, the Alexander polynomial is given by $(t^2-t+1)^2$. For the proof, we first reduce the assertion to maximal curves and then we compute the fundamental groups for maximal tame torus curves.
We deal with a divisorial contraction in dimension 3 which contracts its exceptional divisor to a cA_1 point. We prove that any such contraction is obtained by a suitable weighted blow-up.
In this paper, we address the following two general problems: given two algebraic varieties in ${\bf C}^n$, find out whether or not they are (1) isomorphic; (2) equivalent under an automorphism of ${\bf C}^n$. Although a complete solution of either of these problems is out of the question at this time, we give here some handy and useful invariants of isomorphic as well as of equivalent varieties. Furthermore, and more importantly, we give a universal procedure for obtaining all possible algebraic varieties isomorphic to a given one, and use it to construct numerous examples of isomorphic, but inequivalent algebraic varieties in ${\bf C}^n$.  Among other things, we establish the following interesting fact: for isomorphic hypersurfaces $\{p(x_1,...,x_n)=0\}$ and $\{q(x_1,...,x_n)=0\}$, the number of zeros of $grad(p)$ might be different from that of $grad(q)$.
Let $X$ be a projective variety, homogeneous under a linear algebraic group. We show that the diagonal of $X$ belongs to a unique irreducible component $H_X$ of the Hilbert scheme of $X\times X$. Moreover, $H_X$ is isomorphic to the ``wonderful completion'' of the connected automorphism group of $X$; in particular, $H_X$ is non-singular. We describe explicitly the degenerations of the diagonal in $X\times X$, that is, the points of $H_X$; these subschemes of $X\times X$ are reduced and Cohen-Macaulay.
Given an algorithm of resolution of singularities satisfying certain conditions (``good algorithms''), natural notions of simultaneous algorithmic resolution, or equiresolution, for families of embedded schemes (parametrized by a reduced scheme $T$) are proposed. It is proved that these conditions are equivalent. Something similar is done for families of sheaves of ideals, here the goal is algorithmic simultaneous principalization. A consequence is that given a family of embedded schemes over a reduced $T$, this parameter scheme can be naturally expressed as a disjoint union of locally closed sets $T_{j}$, such that the induced family on each part $T_{j}$ is equisolvable. In particular, this can be applied to the Hilbert scheme of a smooth projective variety; in fact, our result shows that, in characteristic zero, the underlying topological space of any Hilbert scheme parametrizing embedded schemes can be naturally stratified in equiresolvable families.
By means of a Fourier-Mukai transform we embed moduli spaces of stable bundles on an algebraic curve C as isotropic subvarieties of moduli spaces of mu-stable bundles on the Jacobian variety J(C). When g(C)=2 this provides new examples of special Lagrangian submanifolds.
We prove a duality formula for two ${\cal D}$-modules arising from logarithmic derivations w.r.t. a plane curve. As an application we give a differential proof of a logarithmic comparison theorem of Calder\'on-Mond-Narv\'aez-Castro.
We prove that the higher direct images of the dualizing sheaf of a Lagrangian fibration between smooth projective manifolds are isomorphic to the cotangent bundles of base space.  As a corollary, we obtain that every Hodge number of the base space of a fibre space of an irreducible symplectic manifold is the same to that of a projective space if the base space is smooth.
We use pluriharmonic maps to study representations of fundamental groups of algebraic manifolds. This approach is functorial in the sense that the restriction of such a map to a fiber of a fibration remains pluriharmonic, and on this basis, we can investigate the relation between the properties of the original representation and what can be inferred by restricting it to the fibers of a fibration.
We give a characteristic-free proof that general codimension-1 Schubert varieties meet transversally in a Grassmannian and in some related varieties. Thus the corresponding intersection numbers computed in the Chow (and quantum Chow) rings of these varieties are enumerative in all characteristics. We show that known transversality results do not apply to these enumerative problems, emphasizing the need for additional theoretical work on transversality. The method of proof also strengthens some results in real enumerative geometry.
We consider the variety of $(p+1)$-tuples of matrices $M_j$ from given conjugacy classes from $GL(n,{\bf C})$ such that $M_1... M_{p+1}=I$. This variety is connected with the Deligne-Simpson problem and the matrices $M_j$ are interpreted as monodromy operators of regular systems on Riemann's sphere. We consider among others cases when the dimension of the variety is higher than the expected one due to the presence of $(p+1)$-tuples with non-trivial centralizers.
The Mellin transform of fibre integral is calculated for certain isolated singularities of quasihomogeneous complete intersections (especially the unimodal singualrities of the list by Giusti and Wall). We show the property of symmetry between spectra of Gauss-Manin and shed light on the lattice structure of poles of the Mellin transform by means of topological data of the singularity. As an application, Hodge numbers of the Milnor fibre are expressed by counting the spectra of Gauss-Manin.
We give a construction of Witten's "top Chern class" on the compactified moduli space of curves with higher spin structures and show that it satisfies most of the axioms proposed in math.AG/9905034.
We study algebraic fiber spaces $f:X \longrightarrow Y$ where $Y$ is of maximal Albanese dimension. In particular we give an effective version a theorem of Kawamata: If $P_m(X)=1$ for some $m \ge 2$, then the Albanese map of $X$ is surjective. Combining this with \cite{CH} it follows that $X$ is birational to an abelian variety if and only if $P_2(X)=1$ and $q(X)= \text{\rm dim} (X)$.
Dans cet expos\'e, nous expliquons le r\'esultat suivant d\'emontr\'e r\'ecemment par Abramovich, Karu, Matsuki et W{\l}odarczyk : toute application birationnelle entre deux vari\'et\'es alg\'ebriques compl\`etes et lisses sur un corps alg\'ebriquement clos de caract\'eristique nulle se factorise en une suite finie d'\'eclatements et de contractions de centres lisses. Ce r\'esultat n'aurait sans doute pas vu le jour sans la d\'emonstration de son analogue dans le cadre de la g\'eom\'etrie torique par Morelli et W{\l}odarczyk au milieu des ann\'ees 90. La d\'emonstration donn\'ee par Abramovich, Karu, Matsuki et W{\l}odarczyk est une r\'eduction au cas torique, nous en donnons les grandes \'etapes.
Monodromy groups, i.e. the groups of isometries of the intersection lattice L_X:=H_2/torsion generated by the monodromy action of all deformation families of a given surface, have been computed in math.AG/0006231 for any minimal elliptic surface with p_g>q=0. New and refined methods are now employed to address the cases of minimal elliptic surfaces with p_g+1>q>0. To this end we find explicit families such that any isometry is in the group generated by their monodromies or does not respect the invariance of the canonical class or the spinor norm. The monodromy action is moreover shown to act by the full symplectic group on the first homology modulo torsion.
It is a classical result (apparently due to Tate) that all elliptic curves with a torsion point of order n ($4 \leq n \leq 10$, or n = 12) lie in a one-parameter family. However, this fact does not appear to have been used ever for computing the torsion of an elliptic curve. We present here a extremely down-to-earth algorithm using the existence of such a family.
We describe smooth rational projective algebraic surfaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2 which contain $n \ge \b_2-2$ disjoint smooth rational curves with self-intersection -2, where $\b_2$ is the second Betti number. In the last section this is applied to the study of minimal complex surfaces of general type with $p_g = 0$ and $K^2 = 8, 9$ which admit an automorphism of order 2.
This is an expository paper concerning topics on rational points of curves defined over finite fields based on a paper by St"ohr and Voloch.
Let $C$ be an isolated plane curve singularity, and $(C,l)$ be a decorated curve. In this article we compare the equisingular deformations of $C$ and the sandwiched singularity $X(C,l)$. We will prove that for $l \gg 0$ the functor of equisingular deformations of $C$ and $(C,l)$ are equivalent. From this we deduce a proof of a formula for the dimension of the equisingular stratum.   Furthermore we will show how compute the equisingularity ideal of the curve singularity $C$, given the minimal (good) resolution of $C$.
Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristics (0,p). Given an order p-automorphism of a formal disc (or annulus) over R, we describe the minimal semi-stable model for which the specialisations of fixed points are distincts and lie in the smooth locus of the special fiber. The description leads to a combinatorial object called Hurwitz tree. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for a Hurwitz tree to arise from an order p-automorphism.
We prove that the dimension 0 part of the tautological ring of the moduli space of stable pointed curves is one-dimensional. This provides the first genus-free evidence for a conjecture of Faber and Pandharipande that the tautological ring of the moduli space is Gorenstein, answering in the affirmative a question of Hain and Looijenga.
We propose a generalization of the classical theta function to higher cohomology of the polarization line bundle on a family of complex tori with positive index. The constructed cocycles vary horizontally with respect to the (projective) flat connection on this family coming from a heat operator. They also possess modular properties similar to the classical ones.
The stable rationality of components of the moduli space of (unparametrized) rational curves in projective $n$-space with fixed normal bundle is proved, provided these components dominate the moduli space of immersed rational curves in the plane.
Assuming suitable convergence properties for the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ one may construct a polarized variation of Hodge structure over the complexified K\"ahler cone of $X$. In this paper we show that, in the case of fourfolds, there is a correspondence between ``quantum potentials'' and polarized variations of Hodge structures that degenerate to a maximally unipotent boundary point. Under this correspondence, the WDVV equations are seen to be equivalent to the Griffiths' trasversality property of a variation of Hodge structure.
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a Cohen-Macaulay map of finite type between Noetherian schemes, and $:Y'\to Y$ a base change map, with $Y'$ Noetherian. Let $f'$ be the base change of $f$ under $g$ and $g'$ the base change of $g$ under $f$. We show that there is a canonical isomorphism between ${g'}^*\omega_f$ and $\omega_{f'}$, where $\omega_f$ and $\omega_{f'}$ are the relative dualizing sheaves. The map underlying this isomorphism is easily described when $f$ is proper, and has subtler description when $f$ is not. If $f$ is smooth we show that this map between the dualizing sheaves corresponds to the canonical identification of differential forms. Our results generalize the results of B. Conrad in two directions - wedo not need the properness assumption, and we do not need to assume that theschemes involved carry dualizing complexes. Residual complexes do not appear in this paper.
Mathematical instanton bundles of rank 4 and $c_2=2$ on ${\mathbb P}^4$ have a smoothquasiprojective moduli space, which is shown via a direct GIT construction. A complete classification of jumping lines of these vector bundles is obtained. The duals of these bundles are described. Dimension computations and irreducibility proofs for some "interesting" subsets of the moduli space are presented. Restrictions of vector bundles from ${\mathbb P}^4$ to ${\mathbb P}^3$ are shown to produce mathematical instanton bundles on ${\mathbb P}^3$.
We consider geometrical problems on Gorenstein hypersurface orbifolds of dimension $n \geq 4$ through the theory of Hilbert scheme of group orbits. For a linear special group $G$ acting on $\CZ^n$, we study the $G$-Hilbert scheme, $\hl^G(\CZ^n)$, and crepant resolutions of $\CZ^n/G$ for $G$=the $A$-type abelian group $ A_r(n)$. For $n=4$, we obtain the explicit structure of $\hl^{A_r(4)}(\CZ^4)$. The crepant resolutions of $\CZ^4/A_r(4)$ are constructed through their relation with $\hl^{A_r(4)}(\CZ^4)$, and the connections between these crepant resolutions are found by the "flop" procedure of 4-folds. We also make some primitive discussion on $\hl^G(\CZ^n)$ for the $G$= alternating group ${\goth A}_{n+1}$ of degree $n+1$ with the standard representation on $\CZ^n$; the detailed structure of $\hl^{{\goth A}_4}(\CZ^3)$ is explicitly constructed.
A general canonical curve X determines a finite set T(X) of hyperplanes, which is in bijective correspondence with the set of odd theta-characteristics of X. The definition of T(X) can be extended to certain singular curves, in a way that is compatible with degenerations. If X is a Deligne-Mumford stable curve (or a cuspidal curve), we describe the enumerative and local geometry of T(X); this is applied to show that some singular curves are uniquely determined by T(X). This work generalizes the preliminary steps used in AG/0008239 (with E. Sernesi) to show that a general curve of genus 3 can be recovered from its odd theta-characteristics.
Some time ago the first author suggested two different constructions of Grassmannian n-logarithms. One of them works for all n, but its motivic nature is hidden. The other is a motivic but so far available only for n=2,3,4. We derived some general results about the first construction of Grassmannian polylogarithms, and found an explicit relation between the two constructions of the Grassmannian trilogarithms.
We express the Aomoto trilogarithm explicitely via classical trilogarithm and investigate the algebraic-geometric structures behind this: different realuzations of the weight three motivic complexes.   Using this results we give an explicit motivic construction of the Grassmannian 4-logarithm and Borel regulator map for K_7(C).
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, $F$ be an algebraically closed extension of $k$ of transcendence degree one, and $G$ be the group of automorphisms over $k$ of the field $F$. The purpose of this note is to calculate the group of continuous automorphisms of $G$.
This paper is devoted to a very classical problem that can be summarized as follows: let S be a non singular compact complex surface, f:S --> P^2 a finite morphism having simple branching, B the branch curve: to what extent does B determine f? The problem was first studied by Chisini who proved that B determines S and f, assuming B to have only nodes and cusps as singularities, the degree d of f to be greater than 5, and a very strong hypothesis on the possible degenerations of B, and posed the question if the first or the third hypothesis could be weakened. Recently Kulikov and Nemirovski proved the result for d >= 12, and B having only nodes and cusps as singularities. In this paper we weaken the hypothesis about the singularities of B: we generalize the theorem of Kulikov and Nemirovski for B having only singularities of type {x^n=y^m}, in the additional hypothesis of smoothness for the ramification divisor. Moreover we exhibit a family of counterexamples showing that our additional hypothesis is necessary.
We give a simple proof of the statement that every rational curve in the primitive class of a general K3 surface is nodal.
A linear algebraic group $G$ is represented by the linear space of its algebraic functions $F(G)$ endowed with multiplication and comultiplication which turn it into a Hopf algebra. Supplying $G$ with a Poisson structure, we get a quantized version $F_q(G)$ which has the same linear structure and comultiplication, but deformed multiplication. This paper develops a similar theory for abelian varieties. A description of abelian varieties $A$ in terms of linear algebra data was given by Mumford: $F(G)$ is replaced by the graded ring of theta functions with symmetric automorphy factors, and comultiplication is replaced by the Mumford morphism $M^*$ acting on pairs of points as $M(x,y)=M(x+y,x-y).$ After supplementing this by a Poisson structure and replacing the classical theta functions by the quantized ones, introduced by the author earlier, we obtain a structure which essentially coincides with the classical one so far as comultiplication is concerned, but has a deformed multiplication which moreover becomes only partial. The classical graded ring is thus replaced by a linear category. Another important difference from the linear case is that abelian varieties with different period groups (for multiplication) and different quantization parameters (for comultiplication) become interconnected after quantization.
Let $V$ be a plane smooth cubic curve over a finitely generated field $k.$ The Mordell-Weil theorem for $V$ states that there is a finite subset $P\subset V(k)$ such that the whole $V(k)$ can be obtained from $P$ by drawing secants and tangents through pairs of previously constructed points and consecutively adding their new intersection points with $V.$ Equivalently, the group of birational transformations of $V$ generated by reflections with respect to $k$-points is finitely generated. In this paper, elaborating an idea from [M3], we establish a Mordell-Weil type finite generation result for some birationally trivial cubic surfaces $W$. To the contrary, we prove that the birational automorphism group generated by reflections cannot be finitely generated if $W(k)$ is infinite.
We investigate the bad reduction of certain Shimura varieties (associated to the symplectic group). More precisely, we look at a model of the Shimura variety at a prime p, with parahoric level structure at p. We show that this model is flat, as conjectured by Rapoport and Zink, and that its special fibre is reduced.
This work is intended as an introduction to the statement and the construction of the local Langlands correspondence for GL(n) over p-adic fields. The emphasis lies on the statement and the explanation of the correspondence.
We study correspondences of zero-dimensional subschemes of a smooth variety X "aligned" in the same way in inside the appropriate product of Hilbert schemes. We show that such correspondences have etale covering by other such correspondences that are affine bundles over flag bundles on the tangent bundle of X. Moreover, we show that for many such coverings, the closures of the correspondences having these coverings vary so much that there is no compactification of the covering dominating all of these closures.
We give a method of counting the number of curves with a given type of singularity in a suitably ample linear series on a smooth surface using punctual Hilbert schemes. The types of singulaties for which our methods suffice include the topological type with local equation x^a +y^b with b-1 < a < 3b+1. We work out the example of curves with the analytic type of singularity with local equation x^2+y^n for 1<n<9.
For an arbitrary field K, let I be an ideal in the ring K[[x,y]] expressible as a polynomial in either the pair of ideals (x, y^4) and (x,y) or the pair (x,y^3) and (x^2, y). Let G be the group of automorphisms of K[[x,y]] sending the ideal (x,y^2) to itself. Then the normalization of the closure of the G orbit of I is a toric variety. We use the interplay of the properties of Hilbert schemes and toric varieties to study these spaces.
We consider Fujita's freeness conjecture in a relative setting and prove a criterion by proving a correct Q-divisor version of the Kollar vanishing theorem.
In this paper, we prove that the family of $\Bbb Q$-Fano threefolds with Picard number one is birationally unbounded.
This paper reproves a general form of the Green-Lazarsfeld 'generic vanishing' theorem and more recent strengthenings, as well as giving some new applications.
We prove the invariance of plurigenera under smooth projective deformations of varieties with nonnegative Kodaira dimensions.
We remark the density of the jumping loci of the Picard number of a hyperk\"ahler manifold under small one-dimensional deformation and provide some applications for the Mordell-Weil groups of Jacobian K3 surfaces.
The aim of this note is to characterize a K3 surface of Klein-Mukai type in terms of its symmetry.
In this paper we finish the topological classification of real algebraic surfaces of Kodaira dimension zero and we make a step towards the Enriques classification of real algebraic surfaces, by describing in detail the structure of the moduli space of real hyperelliptic surfaces.   Moreover, we point out the relevance in real geometry of the notion of the orbifold fundamental group of a real variety, and we discuss related questions on real varieties $(X, \sigma)$ whose underlying complex manifold $X$ is a $K (\pi, 1)$.   Our first result is that if $(S, \sigma)$ is a real hyperelliptic surface, then the differentiable type of the pair $(S, \sigma)$ is completely determined by the orbifold fundamental group exact sequence. This result allows us to determine all the possible topological types of $(S, \sigma)$, and to prove that they are exactly 78.   It follows also as a corollary that there are exactly eleven cases for the topological type of the real part of S.   Finally, we show that once we fix the topological type of $(S, \sigma)$ corresponding to a real hyperelliptic surface, the corresponding moduli space is irreducible (and connected).   We also give, through a series of tables, explicit analytic representations of the 78 components of the moduli space.
Unfortunately, some proofs in the first version of this paper were incorrect. In this revised version, some minor gaps are fixed, one serious mistake found. The main theorem is now claimed only under a restrictive technical assumption. This invalidates the application to quotient singularities by the Weyl group of type $G_2$. Everything else still stands (in particular, the claim that every symplectic resolution is semismall).
In this note, we prove that the Q-Picard group of the moduli space of n-pointed stable curves of genus g over an algebraically closed field is generated by the tautological classes. We also prove that the cycle map to the 2nd etale cohomology group is bijective.
In this paper we complete the proof began by A. Polishchuk and E. Zaslow (math.AG/9801119) of a weak version of Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for elliptic curves. The main difference to the work of Polishchuk and Zaslow is that we consider morphisms between any pair of objects, not only in the transversal case. This enables us to show the conjectured equivalence of categories.
This is an expanded comment on Barannikov's paper math.AG/0006193. A symplectic version of his construction is discussed. It is shown that the duality transformation for mirror torus fibrations over the same Monge-Ampere manifold exchanges semi-infinite A-variations of Hodge structure introduced in this paper with Barannikov's semi-infinite B-variations of Hodge structure.
We classify stably simple reducible curve singularities in complex spaces of any dimension. This extends the same classification of of irreducible curve singularities obtained by V.I.Arnold. The proof is essentially based on the method of complete transversals by J.W.Bruce et al.
In their paper "Quantum cohomology of projective bundles over $P^n$" (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. (1998)350:9 3615-3638) Z.Qin and Y.Ruan introduce interesting techniques for the computation of the quantum ring of manifolds which are projectivized bundles over projective spaces; in particular, in the case of splitting bundles they prove under some restrictions the formula of Batyrev about the quantum ring of toric manifolds. Here we prove the formula of Batyrev on the quantum Chern-Leray equation for a large class of splitting bundles.
We introduce and study configuration schemes, which are obtained by ``glueing'' usual schemes along closed embeddings. The category of coherent sheaves on a configuration scheme is investigated. Smooth configuration schemes provide alternative ``resolutions of singularities'' of usual singular schemes. We consider in detail the case when the singular scheme is a union of hyperplanes in a projective space.
The moduli space of generalized deformations of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is computed in terms of the Jacobian ring of the defining polynomial. The fibers of the tangent bundle to this moduli space carry algebra structures, which are identified using subalgebras of a deformed Jacobian ring.
The Betti numbers of moduli spaces of representations of a universal central extension of a surface group in the groups U(2,1) and SU(2,1) are calculated. The results are obtained using the identification of these moduli spaces with moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, and Morse theory, following Hitchin's programme. This requires a careful analysis of critical submanifolds which turn out to have a description using either symmetric products of the surface or moduli spaces of Bradlow pairs.
Generalizing homogeneous spectra for rings graded by natural numbers, we introduce multihomogeneous spectra for rings graded by abelian groups. Such homogeneous spectra have the same completeness properties as their classical counterparts, but are possibly nonseparated. We relate them to ample families of invertible sheaves and simplicial toric varieties. As an application, we generalize Grothendieck's Algebraization Theorem and show that formal schemes with certain ample families are algebraizable.
We construct an equivalence between the derived category of sheaves on an elliptic threefold without a section and a derived category of twisted sheaves (modules over an Azumaya algebra) on any small resolution of its relative Jacobian.
On plane algebraic curves the so-called Weierstrass kernel plays the same role of the Cauchy kernel on the complex plane. A straightforward prescription to construct the Weierstrass kernel is known since one century. How can it be extended to the case of more general curves obtained from the intersection of hypersurfaces in a $n$ dimensional complex space? This problem is solved in this work in the case $n=3$. As an application, the correlation functions of bosonic string theories are constructed on a canonical curve of genus four.
For a normal subvariety $V$ of ${\bf C}^n$ with a good ${\bf C}^*$-action we give a simple characterization for when it has only log canonical, log terminal or rational singularities. Moreover we are able to give formulas for the plurigenera of isolated singular points of such varieties and of the logarithmic Kodaira dimension of $V\backslash \{0\}$. For this purpose we introduce sheaves of $m$-canonical and $L^{2,m}$-canonical forms on normal complex spaces. For the case of affine varieties with good ${\bf C}^*$-action we give an explicit formula for these sheaves in terms of the grading of the dualizing sheaf and its tensor powers.
Let $X$ be a smooth complete curve, $G$ be a reductive group and $P\subset G$ a parabolic.   Following Drinfeld, one defines a compactification $\widetilde{\on{Bun}}_P$ of the moduli stack of $P$-bundles on $X$.   The present paper is concerned with the explicit description of the Intersection Cohomology sheaf of $\widetilde{\on{Bun}}_P$. The description is given in terms of the combinatorics of the Langlands dual Lie algebra $\check{\mathfrak g}$.
To any graded Frobenius algebra A we associate a sequence of graded Frobenius algebras A^[n] in such a way that for any smooth projective surface X with trivial canonical divisor there is a canonical isomorphism of rings between (H*X)^[n] and the cohomology H*(X^[n]) of the n-th Hilbert scheme of X.
We introduce orbifold Euler numbers for normal surfaces with Q-divisors. These numbers behave multiplicatively under finite maps and in the log canonical case we prove that they satisfy the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau type inequality. As a corollary we prove effective versions of Bogomolov's result on boundedness of rational curves in some surfaces of general type. Finally, we give some applications to singularities of plane curves.
We describe representations of certain superconformal algebras in the semi-infinite Weil complex related to the loop algebra of a complex finite-dimensional Lie algebra and in the semi-infinite cohomology. We show that in the case where the Lie algebra is endowed with a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form, the relative semi-infinite cohomology of the loop algebra has a structure, which is analogous to the classical structure of the de Rham cohomology in K\"ahler geometry.
The moduli space of abelian surfaces with polarisation of type (1,6) and a bilevel structure has positive Kodaira dimension. By contrast, Mukai has shown that the moduli space of bilevel-t abelian sufaces is rational for t=2,3,4,5.
This paper is devoted to the classification of irregular surfaces of general type with $p_g=q=2$ and non birational bicanonical map. The main result is that, if $S$ is such a surface and if $S$ is minimal with no pencil of curves of genus 2, then $S$ is a double cover of a principally polarized abelian surface $(A,\Theta)$, with $\Theta$ irreducible. The double cover $S\to A$ is branched along a divisor $B\in |2\Theta|$, having at most double points and so $K_S^2=4$.
The pencil of conics featuring three degenerate conics each of which is a line-pair is briefly inspected in a Galois field of characteristic two. It is shown that if two degenerates are conjugate imaginary line pairs, the third must be a real line pair; this contradicts Campbell's claim (Campbell 1927) that all the three singular conics are conjugate imaginary line pairs.
In this paper we study the relationship between two different compactifications of the space of vector bundle quotients of an arbitrary vector bundle on a curve. One is Grothendieck's Quot scheme, while the other is a moduli space of stable maps to the relative Grassmannian.   We establish an essentially optimal upper bound on the dimension of the two compactifications. Based on that, we prove that for an arbitrary vector bundle, the Quot schemes of quotients of large degree are irreducible and generically smooth. We precisely describe all the vector bundles for which the same thing holds in the case of the moduli spaces of stable maps. We show that there are in general no natural morphisms between the two compactifications. Finally, as an application, we obtain new cases of a conjecture on effective base point freeness for pluritheta linear series on moduli spaces of vector bundles.
We prove the invariance of plurigenera under smooth projective deformations in full generality. The proof is done by several estimates of singular hermitian metrics in terms of $L^{2}$-extension theorem of holomorphic sections.
We classify smooth toric Fano varieties of dimension $n\geq 3$ containing a toric divisor isomorphic to $\PP^{n-1}$. As a consequence of this classification, we show that any smooth complete toric variety $X$ of dimension $n\geq 3$ with a $T$-fixed point $x\in X$ such that the blow-up $B_x(X)$ of $X$ at $x$ is Fano is isomorphic either to $\PP^n$ or to the blow-up of $\PP^n$ along a $\PP^{n-2}$. As expected, such results are proved using toric Mori theory due to Reid.
We give an explicit description of a real regulator from the cohomology of a Milnor complex associated to a projective algebraic manifold, to a certain quotient of Deligne cohomology.
We study abelian subgroups of Galois groups of function fields.
Let X be a smooth, complete, geometrically connected curve over a field of characteristic p. The geometric Langlands conjecture states that to each irreducible rank n local system E on X one can attach a perverse sheaf on the moduli stack of rank n bundles on X (irreducible on each connected component), which is a Hecke eigensheaf with respect to E. In this paper we derive the geometric Langlands conjecture from a certain vanishing conjecture. Furthermore, using recent results of Lafforgue, we prove this vanishing conjecture, and hence the geometric Langlands conjecture, in the case when the ground field is finite.
Inductive formulas for the Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of stable holomorphic vector bundles of coprime rank and degree over a fixed Riemann surface of genus at least two were obtained by Harder, Narasimhan, Desale and Ramanan using number theoretic methods and the Weil conjectures and were rederived by Atiyah and Bott using gauge theory. In this note we observe that there are similar inductive formulas for determining the Hodge numbers of these moduli spaces.
A new section on projections of coherent sheaves from a projective space to a lower-dimensional projective space has been added.   Also some of the notation has been altered to bring it into line with the joint paper with Eisenbud and Schreyer.
A singular Moishezon space is not projective even if it is Kaehler. This paper gives a projectivity criterion for Kaehler Moishezon spaces. We shall use this projectivity criterion to show the density of projective symplectic varieties in the Kuranishi family of a (singular) symplectic variety.
In this paper we shall prove that the singular locus of a symplectic singularity has no codimension 3 irreducible components. As a corollary, a symplectic singularity is terminal if and only if its singular locus has codimension $\geq 4$.   It is hoped that a symplectic singularity has much stronger properties.
In this article we investigate Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formulae for line bundles on irreducible symplectic K\"ahler manifolds. As Huybrechts has shown, for every irreducible complex K\"ahler manifold $X$ of dimension $2n$, there are numbers $a_0, a_2, ..., a_{2n}$ such that $\chi(L) = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_{2k}/(2k)! q_X(c_1(L))^k$ for the Euler characteristic of a line bundle $L$, where $q_X: H^2(X, \mathbbm C) \to \mathbbm C$ is the Beauville-Bogomolov quadratic form of $X$.   Using Rozansky-Witten classes similar to Hitchin and Sawon, we obtain a formula expressing the $a_{2k}$ in terms of Chern numbers of $X$. Furthermore, for the $n$-th generalized Kummer variety $\KA n$, we prove $\chi(L) = (n + 1) \binom{q(c_1(L)) / 2 + n} n$ by purely algebro-geometric methods, where $q$ is the form $q_X$ up to a positive rational constant. A similar formula is already known for the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of length $n$ on a K3-surface.   Using our results, we are able to calculate all Chern numbers of the generalized Kummer varieties $\KA n$ for $n \leq 5$. For $n \leq 4$ these results were previously obtained by Sawon.
We show that ample line bundles L on a g-dimensional simple abelian variety, with h^0(L)> 2^g.g!, give projectively normal embeddings, for all g>0.
This is the completely revised version of math.AG/0101071.
We prove that the morphism that maps a rational ruled surface to its singular locus is genericaly injective modulo isomophism and duality. We also calculate the dimension and the degre of its image.
We construct several rigid (i.e., unique in their deformation class) surfaces which have particular behavior with respect to real structures: in one example the surface has no any real structure, in the other one it has a unique real structure and this structure is not maximal with respect to the Smith-Thom inequality. So, it answers in negative to the following problems: existence of real surfaces in each complex deformation class and existence of maximal surfaces in each complex deformation class containing real surfaces. Besides, we prove that there is no real surfaces among the surfaces of general type with $p_g=q=0$ and $K^2=9$.   As a by-product, the surfaces constructed give one more counterexample to "Dif=Def" problem.
Given a smooth and projective curve C and a smooth and projective toric variety X, we first describe a compactification of the space of morphisms from C to X representing a fixed homology class, and after we study the intersection theory on this variety.
Pour tout sch\'ema simplicial complexe $X_{\bullet}$ il existe une application canonique $\nabla:H^{\ast}(X_{\bullet})\longrightarrow \Omega^1_{{\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Q}}\otimes H^{\ast}(X_{\bullet})$, appel\'ee la connexion de Gau\ss-Manin. Nous montrons qu'il existe une unique connexion fonctorielle sur toute structure de Hodge-Tate mixte ayant certaines propri\'et\'es de la connexion de Gau\ss-Manin. Cette connexion n'est pas int\'egrable en g\'en\'eral, et alors son int\'egrabilit\'e est une condition non triviale pour qu'une structure de Hodge soit g\'eom\'etrique.   Dans des cas particuliers, je donne des formules explicites pour la connexion de Gau\ss-Manin sur la cohomologie singuli\`ere des vari\'et\'es alg\'ebriques sur ${\mathbb C}$ dans les termes de la structure de Hodge.
Allcock and Freitag recently showed that the moduli space of marked cubic surfaces is a subvariety of a nine dimensional projective space which is defined by cubic equations. They used the theory of automorphic forms on ball quotients to obtain these results. Here we describe the same embedding using Naruki's toric model of the moduli space. We also give an explicit parametrization of the tritangent divisors, we discuss another way to find equations for the image and we show that the moduli space maps, with degree at least ten, onto the unique quintic hypersurface in a five dimensional projective space which is invariant under the action of the Weyl group of the root system E_6.
We define and calculate the weighted multiplicities of non Gorenstein terminal singularities on threefolds and some quotient singularities. We improve freeness conditions on threefolds.
Let $g$ be a reductive Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. Suppose $g$ acts on a complex of vector spaces $M$ by $i_\lambda$ and $L_\lambda$, which satisfy the identities as contraction and Lie derivative do for smooth differential forms. Out of this data one defines cohomology of the invariants and equivariant cohomology of $M$. We establish Koszul duality between each other.
New local and global non-abelian zeta functions for elliptic curves are studied using certain refined Brill-Noether loci in moduli spaces of semi-stable bundles. Examples of these zeta functions and a justification of using only semi-stable bundles are given too. We end this paper with an appendix on the so-called Weierstrass Groups for general curves, which is motivated by a construction of Euler systems from torsion points (of elliptic curves).
This paper considers normal projective complex surface X with at worst Kawamata log terminal singularities and K_X is numerically trivial. The aim is to prove that there is a finite rational polyhedral cone which is a fundamental domain for the action Aut(X) on the rational convex hull of its ample cone.
We present several approaches to equivariant intersection cohomology. We show that for a complete algebraic variety acted by a connected algebraic group $G$ it is a free module over $H^*(BG)$. The result follows from the decomposition theorem or from a weight argument.
Bolibruch's examples of representations of pi_1(P^1-finitely many points) which are not realizable by Fuchsian differential systems are adapted to curves of higher genus.
We investigate the universal cover of projective threefolds whose tangent bundle is a direct sum of subbundles in case the Kodaira dimension is not 1 and 2. We also prove results on Fano manifolds with splitting tangent bundles in any dimension.
We present a proof of embedded desingularization for closed subschemes which does not make use of Hilbert-Samuel function and avoids Hironaka's notion of normal flatness.   This proof, already sketched in [A course on constructive desingularization and equivariance. In {\em Resolution of singularities (Obergurgl, 1997)}, vol. 181 {\em Progr. Math.}, Birkh\"auser, 2000.] page 224, is done by showing that desingularization of a closed subscheme $X$, in a smooth sheme W, is achieved by taking an algorithmic principalization for the ideal $I(X)$, associated to the embedded scheme $X$.
In this note a proof of a differential analog of Chevalley's theorem \cite{C} on homomorphism extensions is given. An immediate corollary is a condition of finitenes of extensions of differential algebras and several equivalent definitions of a differentially closed field, including Kolchin's Nullstellensatz.
In this paper we study the monodromy action on the first Betti and de Rham non-abelian cohomology arising from a family of smooth curves. We describe sufficient conditions for the existence of a Zariski dense monodromy orbit. In particular we show that for a Lefschetz pencil of sufficiently high degree the monodromy action is dense.
In this paper we prove certain Hurwitz equivalence properties of $B_n$. In particular we prove that for $n=3$ every two Artin's factorizations of $\Delta _3 ^2$ of the form $H_{i_1} ... H_{i_6}, \quad F_{j_1} ... F_{j_6}$ (with $i_k, j_k \in \{1,2 \}$) where $\{H_1, H_2 \}, \{F_1, F_2 \}$ are frames, are Hurwitz equivalent. The proof provided here is geometric, based on a newly defined frame type. The results will be applied to the classification of algebraic surfaces up to deformation. It is already known that there exist surfaces that are diffeomorphic to each other but are not deformations of each other (Manetti example). We are constructing a new invariant based on Hurwitz equivalence class of factorization, to distinguish among diffeomorphic surfaces which are not deformation of each other.
Let $(C,\iota)$ be a stable curve with an involution. Following a classical construction one can define its Prym variety $P$, which in this case turns out to be a semiabelian group variety and usually not complete. In this paper we study the question whether there are ``good'' compactifications of $P$ in analogy to compactified Jacobians. The answer to this question depends on whether we consider degenerations of principally polarized Prym varieties or degenerations with the induced (non-principal) polarization. We describe degeneration data of such degenerations. The main application of our theory lies in the case of degenerations of principally polarized Prym varieties where we ask whether such a degeneration depends on a given one-parameter family containing $(C,\iota)$ or not. This allows us to determine the indeterminacy locus of the Prym map.
We show that there are obstructions to the existence of certain types of invariant subspaces of the Milnor monodromy; this places restrictions on the cohomology of Milnor fibres of non-isolated hypersurface singularities.
The quotient-cusp singularities are isolated complex surface singularities that are double-covered by cusp singularities. We show that the universal abelian cover of such a singularity, branched only at the singular point, is a complete intersection cusp singularity of embedding dimension 4. This supports a general conjecture that we make about the universal abelian cover of a $\Q$-Gorenstein singularity.
Given a complex manifold $X$, a normal crossing divisor $D\subset X$ whose irreducible components $D_1,...,D_s$ are smooth, and a choice of natural numbers $r=(r_1,...,r_s)$, we construct a manifold $X(D,\ur)$ with an action of a torus $\Gamma$ and we prove that some full subcategory of the category of $\Gamma$-equivariant vector bundles on $X(D,r)$ is equivalent to the category of parabolic vector bundles on $(X,D)$ in which the lengths of the filtrations over each irreducible component of $X$ are given by $r$. When $X$ is Kaehler, we study the Kaehler cone of $X(D,r)$ and the relation between the corresponding notions of slope-stability.
On a stack of stable maps, the psi classes are modified by subtracting certain boundary divisors. These modified psi classes are compatible with forgetful morphisms, and are well-suited to enumerative geometry: tangency conditions allow simple expressions in terms of modified psi classes. Topological recursion relations are established among their top products in genus zero, yielding effective recursions for characteristic numbers of rational curves in any projective homogeneous variety. In higher genus, the obtained numbers are only virtual, due to contributions from spurious components of the space of maps. For the projective plane, the necessary corrections are determined in genus 1 and 2 to give the characteristic numbers in these cases.
R. Hartshorne conjectured and F. Zak proved that any n-dimensional smooth non-degenerate complex algebraic variety X in a m-dimensional projective space P satisfies Sec(X)=P if m<3n/2+2. In this article, I deal with the limiting case of this theorem, namely the Severi varieties, defined by the conditions m=3n/2+2 and Sec(X) different from P. I want to give a different proof of a theorem of F. Zak classifying all Severi varieties: I will prove that any Severi variety is homogeneous and then deduce their classification and the following geometric property : the derivatives of the equation of Sec(X), which is a cubic hypersurface, determine a birational morphism of P.
This paper explores the birational geometry of a general Horrocks-Mumford quintic threefold, describing the set of all minimal models up to marked isomorphism, the movable fan (the way in which the nef cones of all these models are arranged to form the movable cone), and the birational automorphism group. There are infinitely many models up to marked isomorphism, falling into just eight (unmarked-) isomorphism classes.
In this paper, we introduce (local and) global non-abelian zeta functions for general curves. As an example, we compute the so-called rank two zeta functions for genus two curves by studying non-abelian Brill-Noether loci and their infinitesimal structures.
The goal is to verify the Hodge conjecture (and some related conjectures) for certain moduli spaces. It is shown that the (generalized) Hodge conjecture holds for the projective moduli spaces of vector bundles over an abelian or K3 surface or a curve if it holds for all powers of the surface or curve. In the latter case, the curve can be replaced by its Jacobian. As a consequence the generalized Hodge conjecture holds for these moduli spaces when the curve is very general. A similar result is proved for the Hilbert schemes of points over an arbitrary surface.
We show that a real rational (over $\C$) surfaces are quasi-simple, i.e., that such a surface is determined up to deformation in the class of real surfaces by the topological type of its real structure.
Theorems of Barth-Lefschetz type describe restrictions on the topology of varieties of small codimension. R. Schoen and J. Wolfson, using Morse theory on a path space, have described a technique to prove theorems of this kind for complex submanifolds of K\"ahler manifolds of non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature. In this paper this program is carried out for the compact Hermitian symmetric spaces. The key technical point is to define and compute an invariant, called the {\it complex positivity}, that measures the ``amount'' of positive curvature, in a suitable sense.
This note pursues the techniques of modified psi classes on the stack of stable maps (cf. [Graber-Kock-Pandharipande]) to give concise solutions to the characteristic number problem of rational curves in P^2 or P^1 x P^1 with a cusp or a prescribed triple contact. The classes of such loci are computed in terms of modified psi classes, diagonal classes, and certain codimension-2 boundary classes. Via topological recursions the generating functions for the numbers can then be expressed in terms of the usual characteristic number potentials.
We prove that the largest accumulation point of the set $\mathcal{T}_3$ of all three-dimensional log canonical thresholds $c(X,F)$ is 5/6.
This is the unabridged web version of the paper that will be published on the American Journal of Mathematics.   In this paper, we study the birational geometry of certain examples of mildly singular quartic 3-folds. A quartic 3-fold is an example of a Fano variety, that is, a variety $X$ with ample anticanonical sheaf $\O_X(-K_X)$. From the point of view of birational geometry they basically fall within two classes: either $X$ is ``close to being rational'', and then it has very many biregularly distinct birational models as a Fano 3-fold, or, at the other extreme, $X$ has a unique model and it is often even true that every birational selfmap of $X$ is biregular. In this paper we construct examples of singular quartic 3-folds with exactly two birational models as Fano 3-folds.
This paper studies the infinitesimal variation of the Lefschetz decomposition associated with a compatible sl_2-representation on a graded algebra. This allows to prove that the Jordan-Lefschetz property holds infinitesimally for the Kaehler Lie algebra (introduced by Looijenga and Lunts) of any compact Kaehler manifold. As a second application we describe how the space of harmonic forms changes when a Ricci-flat Kaehler form is deformed infinitesimally.
The main result of this paper is the following: let d be a natural number >= 3; the line bundle O(1,...,1) on the product of d copies of the projective line P^1 satisfies Property N_p of Green-Lazarsfeld if and only if p <= 3.
We give an explicit combinatorial description of the irreducible components of the singular locus of a Schubert variety in a flag variety of type A. This implies a conjecture of Lakshmibai and Sandhya.
We prove that the complement of a very generic curve of degree $d$ at least equal to 15 in the projective plane is hyperbolic in the sens of Kobayashi (here, the terminology ``very generic'' refers to complements of countable unions of proper algebraic subsets of the parameter space). We first consider the Dethloff and Lu's generalisation to the logarithmic situation of Demailly's jet bundles. We study their base loci for surfaces of log-general type in the same way as it was done in the compact case by Demailly and El Goul. With some condition on log-Chern classes, any entire holomorphic map to the surface can be lifted as a leaf of some foliation on a ramified covering. Then we obtain a logarithmic analogue of McQuillan's result on holomorphic foliations which permits to conclude. Using the logarithmic formalism, we even obtain some simplifications of the original proof in McQuillan's work.
We reformulate a conjecture of Deligne on 1-motives by using the integral weight filtration of Gillet and Soul\'e on cohomology, and prove it. This implies the original conjecture up to isogeny. If the degree of cohomology is at most two, we can prove the conjecture for the Hodge realization without isogeny, and even for 1-motives with torsion.
We construct an explicit asymptotically good tower of curves over the field with eight elements. Its limit is 3/2.
In this paper (part of the author's PhD thesis), we introduce the notions of semistability and potential semistability of overconvergent F-crystals over an equal characteristic local field. We establish their equivalence with the notions of unipotency and quasi-unipotency given by Crew, and to recast the conjecture that every overconvergent crystal is quasi-unipotent in terms of potential semistability. Consequences, including an extension of de Jong's extension theorem for F-crystals to the logarithmic case, will appear in a subsequent paper.
We provide a construction of the moduli spaces of framed Hitchin pairs and their master spaces. These objects have come to interest as algebraic versions of solutions of certain coupled vortex equations by work of Lin and Stupariu. Our method unifies and generalizes constructions of several similar moduli spaces. Here are some points which are also of interest in other similar situations: - Our construction does not require the symmetricity condition that the map ^2G x E -> E be zero, usually appearing in the context of Higgs bundles. - We carry out a detailed analysis of the polynomial stability parameter without referring to GIT. This sheds some light on intrinsic properties of such parameter dependent stability concepts. - The construction corrects an inaccuracy in our previous construction of the compactification of the Hitchin space and generalizes it.
Let X be a smooth variety and Y a closed subscheme of X. By comparing motivic integrals on X and on a log resolution of (X,Y), we prove the following formula for the log canonical threshold of (X,Y): c(X,Y)=dim X-sup_m{(dim Y_m}/(m+1)}, where Y_m is the mth jet scheme of Y. We show how this formula can be used to study the log canonical threshold. In particular, we give a proof of the Semicontinuity theorem of Demailly and Koll\'ar.
Replacing symmetric powers by divided powers and working over Witt vectors instead of ground fields, I generalize Kawamatas T^1-lifting theorem to characteristic p>0. Combined with the work of Deligne-Illusie on degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequences, this gives unobstructedness for certain Calabi-Yau varieties with free crystalline cohomology modules.
We prove the following result : Let $E$ be a rank 2 bundle on ${\bf P}$, the projective space of dimension 3, and $n$ a relative number such that $H^0E(n-1)=0$ and $H^0E(n)\neq 0$. Let $C$ be a curve which is the zero locus of a section of $H^0E(n)$. Then $C$ is minimal in its biliaison class.
