Markov Chain code is based on [markov-text](https://github.com/codebox/markov-text), originally written by [Rob Dawson](http://codebox.org.uk/pages/about).

```
python markov_text/markov.py parse some_guide 3 data/somefile.txt
# some_guide = name of database
# 3 = number of words
# data/somefile.txt = text file
python markov_text/markov.py gen some_guide 2
# 2 = number of sentences to generate
```
